# Notes and Questions

1. Supporting deprecated maker usages like, \h#
2. Is multiple `\usfm` , `\ide`, `\toc#` etc allowed? Does Paratext accept it? Is there a way to specify they are all optional, can be present at max once and can occur in any order?!!
3. readme for `usfm.sty` says it includes a \NotRepeatable property for markers that cannot be repeated under their parent. But not a single use is seen in the `.sty` file!
4. sty file has a restore marker. Can't find it in usfm docs or our old grammar implementation!
