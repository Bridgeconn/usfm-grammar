* In USX we see 3 sections in the introduction part, _bookTitles_, _bookIntroductionTiles_, and _bookIntroductionEndTitles_. What are their relevance when USFM is considered?


* As per USFM doc examples, _\\iex_ and _\\imte_ occurs within/at the end of chapter content...But included in _bookIntroductionTitles_ in the Grammar(as per the list of valid style types in USX doc).

* Use of the markers _\\wg, \\wh, \\wa_ is not clear from documentation. Assuming that it encloses verse's content words and not add additional contents to the verse text.

* In USX we see _opt_break_. How are they/Are they implemented in USFM? (do _\\pb, \\b, ~ and \\\\ etc_ serves its purpose in USFM?) 


* Where does _\\mte_ occur in USFM files? The USFM spec has a mention of _at the end of the introduction_ ... USX doc indicates its within chapter content... (we have assumed its valid within the chapter content).

* Is there a rule, that there should be a _\\p_, or similar marker that shows indentation, at the start of the chapter(or the start of the the first chapter)?
