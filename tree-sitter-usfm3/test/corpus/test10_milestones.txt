\v 11 Jesus stood before the Roman governor, who questioned him. 
\qt-s |who="Pilate"\* “Are
you the king of the Jews?”\qt-e\* he asked.
\p \qt-s |who="Jesus"\*“So you say,”\qt-e\* answered Jesus.
\v 12 But he said nothing in response to the accusations of the chief priests and elders.
\p
\v 13 So Pilate said to him, \qt-s |who="Pilate"\*“Don't you hear all these things they
accuse you of?”\qt-e\*

\v 14 But Jesus refused to answer a single word, with the result that the Governor was greatly
surprised.

people out of the land of Egypt, but that afterward he destroyed those who did not believe.

gave themselves over to fornication and pursued unnatural desires. They were given as

authority, and they say evil things about the glorious ones.
