of the Law say that the Messiah will be the descendant of David?

\q2 Sit here at my right side

\v 37 David himself called him ‘Lord’; so how can the Messiah be David's descendant?”

\v 1 From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus and an apostle chosen and called by God to
preach his Good News.
\p
\v 2 The Good News was promised long ago by God through his prophets, as written in the
Holy Scriptures.
\v 3 It is about his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: as to his humanity, he was born a
descendant of David;
\v 4 as to his divine holiness, he was shown with great power to be the Son of God by being
raised from death.
\v 5 Through him God gave me the privilege of being an apostle for the sake of Christ,
in order to lead people of all nations to believe and obey.
\v 6 This also includes you who are in Rome, whom God has called to belong to Jesus Christ.
\po
\v 7 And so I write to all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his own
people:
\po May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.

\v 22 The apostles, the leaders, and all the church members decided to send some men to
Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Silas and Judas Barsabbas, who were two
leaders of the Lord's followers.
\v 23 They wrote a letter that said:
\pmo We apostles and leaders send friendly greetings to all of you Gentiles who are
followers of the Lord in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.
\pm
\v 24 We have heard that some people from here have terribly upset you by what they said.
But we did not send them!
\v 25 So we met together and decided to choose some men and to send them to you along with
our good friends Barnabas and Paul.
\v 26 These men have risked their lives for our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 27 We are also sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you in person the same things that
we are writing.
\pm
\v 28 The Holy Spirit has shown us that we should not place any extra burden on you.
\v 29 But you should not eat anything offered to idols. You should not eat any meat that
still has the blood in it or any meat of any animal that has been strangled. You must also
not commit any terrible sexual sins. If you follow these instructions, you will do well.
