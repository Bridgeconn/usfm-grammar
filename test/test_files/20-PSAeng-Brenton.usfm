\c 1  
\q1
\v 1 Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of \f + \fr 1:1  \fl Gr. \ft pestilent. \f* evil men. 
\q1
\v 2 But his \f + \fr 1:2  \fl Gr. \ft will. \f* pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in his law will he meditate day and night. 
\q1
\v 3 And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatsoever he shall do shall be prospered. 
\q1
\v 4 Not so the ungodly; —not so: but rather as the \f + \fr 1:4  \fl Or. \ft dust or down. \f* chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth. 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just. 
\q1
\v 6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. 
\c 2  
\q1
\v 1  \x + \xo 2:1  \xt Acts 4. 25. \x* Wherefore did the heathen rage, and the nations imagine vain things? 
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together, against the Lord, and against his Christ; 
\q1
\v 3  \add saying\add*, Let us break through their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us. 
\q1
\v 4 He that dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them. 
\q1
\v 5 Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his fury. 
\q1
\v 6 But I have been made king by him on Sion his holy mountain, 
\q1
\v 7 declaring the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to me, \x + \xo 2:7  \xt Acts 13. 33. Heb 1. 5. \x* Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen \add for\add* thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth \add for\add* thy possession. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou shalt \f + \fr 2:9  \fl Gr. \ft tend them as a shepherd. Rev. 2. 27. \f* rule them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel. 
\q1
\v 10 Now therefore understand, ye kings: be instructed, all ye that judge the earth. 
\q1
\v 11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling. 
\q1
\v 12  \f + \fr 2:12  \fl Note. \ft - This rendering or a similar one the Jews maintain. \f* Accept correction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye should perish from the righteous way: whensoever his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all they that trust in him. 
\c 3  
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Abessalom. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me. 
\q1
\v 2 Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. \f + \fr 3:2  \ft The word Διάψαλμα (Selah) has been rendered Pause, as most intelligible to the English reader. \f* Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 But thou, O Lord, art my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head. 
\q1
\v 4 I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. 
\q1
\v 5 I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me. 
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about. 
\q1
\v 7 Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. 
\q1
\v 8 Deliverance is the Lord's, and thy blessing is upon thy people. 
\c 4  
\d For the End, a Song of David among \add the \add*Psalms. 
\q1
\v 1 When I called upon \add him\add*, the God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in tribulation; pity me, and hearken to my prayer. 
\q1
\v 2 O ye sons of men, how long \add will ye be\add* \f + \fr 4:2  \fl Lit. \ft heavy of heart. \f* slow of heart? wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. 
\q1
\v 4  \x + \xo 4:4  \xt Eph 4.26. \x* Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts. Pause. 
\q1
\v 5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 6 Many say, Who will shew us good things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou hast put gladness into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil. 
\q1
\v 8 I will \f + \fr 4:8  \fl Or. \ft at the same time. \f* both lie down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely. 
\c 5  
\d For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits. 
\q1
\v 1 Hearken to my words, O Lord, \f + \fr 5:1  \fl Lit. \ft understand. \f* attend to my cry. 
\q1
\v 2 Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to thee, O Lord, will I pray. 
\q1
\v 3 In the morning thou shalt hear my voice: in the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up. 
\q1
\v 4 For thou art not a god that desires iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee. 
\q1
\v 5 Neither shall the transgressors continue in thy sight: thou hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou wilt destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man. 
\q1
\v 7 But I will enter into thine house in the multitude of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple. 
\q1
\v 8 Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way plain before thy face. 
\q1
\v 9 For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their \x + \xo 5:9  \xt Rom 3. 13. \x* throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit. 
\q1
\v 10 Judge them, O God; let them \f + \fr 5:10  \fl Gr. \ft fall from, \fl or, \ft by reason of. \f* fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked thee, O Lord. 
\q1
\v 11 But let all that trust on thee be glad in thee: they shall exult for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them; and all that love thy name shall rejoice in thee. 
\q1
\v 12 For thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: thou hast \f + \fr 5:12  \fl Lit. \ft crowned. \f* compassed us as with a shield of favour. 
\c 6  
\d For the End, a Psalm of David among the Hymns for the eighth. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger. 
\q1
\v 2 Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed. 
\q1
\v 3 My soul also is grievously vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? 
\q1
\v 4 Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy's sake. 
\q1
\v 5 For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades? 
\q1
\v 6  \f + \fr 6:6  \fl Gr. \ft I have laboured. \f* I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with tears. 
\q1
\v 7 Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies. 
\q1
\v 8 Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 
\q1
\v 9 The Lord has hearkened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer. 
\q1
\v 10 Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily. 
\c 7  
\d A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the \f + \fr 7:11  \fl Lit. \ft son of Jemini. \f* Benjamite. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord my God, in thee have I trusted: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. 
\q1
\v 2 Lest at any time \add the enemy\add* seize my soul as a lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save. 
\q1
\v 3 O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if there is unrighteousness in my hands;) 
\q1
\v 4 if I have requited with evil those who requited me \add with good\add*; may I then perish empty by means of my enemies. 
\q1
\v 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, an take it; and let him trample my life on the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. 
\q1
\v 6 Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath; be exalted \f + \fr 7:6  \fqa Heb. 'because of mine enemies.' \f* in the utmost boundaries of mine enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the decree which thou didst command. 
\q1
\v 7 And the congregation of the nations shall compass thee: and for this cause do thou return on high. 
\q1
\v 8 The Lord shall judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my innocence that is in me. 
\q1
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and \add then\add* thou shalt direct the righteous, O God that searchest the hearts and reins. 
\q1
\v 10 My help is righteous, \add coming\add* from God who saves the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 11 God is a righteous judge, and strong, and patient, not inflicting vengeance every day. 
\q1
\v 12 If ye will not repent, he will furbish his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready. 
\q1
\v 13 And on it he has fitted the instruments of death; he has completed his arrows for the \f + \fr 7:13  \ft See \fqa Heb. perhaps 'persecuting ones.' \f* raging ones. 
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he has travailed with unrighteousness, he has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity. 
\q1
\v 15 He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and he shall fall into the ditch which he has made. 
\q1
\v 16 His trouble shall return on his own head, and his unrighteousness shall come down on his own crown. 
\q1
\v 17 I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness; I will sing to the name of the Lord most high. 
\c 8  
\d For the end, concerning the wine-presses, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! for thy magnificence is exalted above the heavens. 
\q1
\v 2  \x + \xo 8:2  \xt Mat 21. 16. \x* Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest put down the enemy and avenger. 
\q1
\v 3 For I will regard the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and stars, which thou hast established. 
\q1
\v 4  \x + \xo 8:4  \xt Heb 2. 6 - 9. \x* What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
\q1
\v 5 Thou madest him a little less than angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour; 
\q1
\v 6 and thou hast set him over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet: 
\q1
\v 7 sheep and all \f + \fr 8:7  \fl Gr. \ft cows. \f* oxen, yea and the cattle of the field; 
\q1
\v 8 the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the \add creatures\add* passing through the paths of the sea. 
\q1
\v 9 O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! 
\c 9  
\d For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning the secrets of the Son. 
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will recount all thy wonderful works. 
\q1
\v 2 I will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou Most High. 
\q1
\v 3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and perish at thy presence. 
\q1
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my cause and my right; thou satest on the throne, that judgest righteousness. 
\q1
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the nations, and the ungodly one has perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever, even for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 6 The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and thou hast destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise, 
\q1
\v 7 but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment. 
\q1
\v 8 And he will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness. 
\q1
\v 9 The Lord also is become a refuge for the poor, a seasonable help, in affliction. 
\q1
\v 10 And let them that know thy name hope in thee: for thou, O Lord, hast not failed them that diligently seek thee. 
\q1
\v 11 Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion: declare his dealings among the nations. 
\q1
\v 12 For he remembered them, \add in\add* making inquisition for blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. 
\q1
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my affliction \add which I suffer\add* of mine enemies, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 
\q1
\v 14 that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will exult in thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 The heathen are caught in the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot taken. 
\q1
\v 16 The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. A song of Pause. 
\q1
\v 17 Let sinners be driven away into Hades, \add even\add* all the nations that forget God. 
\q1
\v 18 For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. 
\q1
\v 19 Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before thee. 
\q1
\v 20 Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are men. Pause. 
\b
\q1 (Psalm 9a\f + \fr 9:20  \fl Note. \ft - Here begins a change of numbers as compared with the \fqa Heb. which continues to Ps. 146, this psalm having no number, and the eleventh being called the tenth. The following verses 21-37 are numbered 1-18 in the original text. \f*) 
\v 21 Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? \add why\add* dost thou overlook \add us\add* in times of need, in affliction? 
\q1
\v 22 While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is \f + \fr 9:22  \fl Gr. \ft inflamed, as in a fever. \f* hotly pursued: \add the wicked\add* are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine. 
\q1
\v 23 Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself. 
\q1
\v 24 The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his \f + \fr 9:24  \fl Or, \ft anger. \f* pride he will not seek after \add him\add*: God is not before him. 
\q1
\v 25 His ways are \f + \fr 9:25  \fl Gr. \ft profaned. \f* profane at all times; thy judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies. 
\q1
\v 26 For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, \add continuing\add* without evil from generation to generation. \x + \xo 9:26  \xt Rom 8. 14. \x* 
\q1
\v 27 Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain. 
\q1
\v 28 He lies in wait with rich \add men\add* in secret places, in order to slay the innocent: his eyes are \f + \fr 9:28  \fl Gr. \ft look. \f* set against the poor. 
\q1
\v 29 He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him \add after him\add*: he will bring him down in his snare. 
\q1
\v 30 He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. 
\q1
\v 31 For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to look. 
\q1
\v 32 Arise, O Lord God; let thy hand be lifted up: forget not the poor. 
\q1
\v 33 Wherefore, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will not require \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 34 Thou seest \add it\add*; for thou dost observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into thy hands: the poor has been left to thee; thou wast a helper to the orphan. 
\q1
\v 35 Break thou the arm of the sinner and wicked man: his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found. 
\q1
\v 36 The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish out his land. 
\q1
\v 37 The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: thine ear has inclined to the preparation of their heart; 
\q1
\v 38 to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man may no more boast upon the earth. 
\c 10  
\d (11 in KJV) For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 In the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, 
\q1
\v 2 Flee to the mountains as a sparrow? 
\q1
\v 3 For behold the sinners have bent their \add bow\add*, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot For \f + \fr 10:3  \fl Gr. \ft in dark moon, or little moonlight, \fl q. d. \ft luce malignâ \f* privily at the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 4 For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the righteous done? 
\q1
\v 5 The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men. 
\q1
\v 6 The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul. 
\q1
\v 7 He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast \add shall be\add* the portion of their cup. 
\q1
\v 8 For the Lord \add is\add* righteous, and loves \f + \fr 10:8  \fl Gr. \ft righteousnesses\f*righteousness; his face beholds uprightness. 
\c 11  
\d (12) For the end, A Psalm of David, upon the eighth. 
\q1
\v 1 Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for \f + \fr 11:1  \fl Gr. \ft truths are become rare \f* truth is diminished from among the children of men. 
\q1
\v 2 Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbour: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words: 
\q1
\v 4 who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord of us? 
\q1
\v 5 Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set \add them\add* in safety; I will speak \add to them\add* thereof openly. 
\q1
\v 6 The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved \add in\add* \f + \fr 11:6  \fl Gr. \ft the earth. \f* a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and shalt preserve us, from this generation, and for ever. 
\q1
\v 8 The ungodly walk around: according to thy greatness thou has greatly exalted the sons of men. 
\c 12  
\d (13) For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me? for ever? how long wilt thou turn away thy face from me? 
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \add having\add* sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
\q1
\v 3 Look on me, hearken to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
\q1
\v 4 lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. 
\q1
\v 5 But I have hoped in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 6 I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high. 
\c 13  
\d (14) For the end, Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted \add themselves\add*, and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after god. 
\q1
\v 3 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. 
\q1
\v 4 Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord. 
\q1
\v 5 There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation. 
\q1
\v 6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope. 
\q1
\v 7 Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad. 
\c 14  
\d (15) A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? and who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? 
\q1
\v 2 He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Who has not spoken craftily with is tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him. 
\q1
\v 4 In his sight an evil-worker is set at nought, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints \add him\add* not. 
\q1
\v 5 He has not \f + \fr 14:5  \fl Gr. \ft given. \f* lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved. 
\c 15  
\d (16) A writing of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped in thee. 
\q1
\v 2 I said to the Lord, Thou art my Lord; for thou has no need of my \f + \fr 15:2  \fl Gr. \ft good deeds, or things. \f* goodness. 
\q1
\v 3 On behalf of the saints that are in his land, he has magnified all his pleasure in them. 
\q1
\v 4 Their weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward they hasted. I will by no means assemble their bloody meetings, neither will I make mention of their names with my lips. 
\q1
\v 5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou art he that restores my inheritance to me. 
\q1
\v 6 The lines have fallen to me in the best places, yea, I have a most excellent heritage. 
\q1
\v 7 I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too have chastened me even \f + \fr 15:7  \fl Possibly, \ft during the night. \fl q. d. \ft as long as night lasted. \f* till night. 
\q1
\v 8 I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. 
\q1
\v 9 Therefore my heart rejoiced an my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
\q1
\v 10 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither \x + \xo 15:10  \xt Rom 13. 35. \x* wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand \add there are\add* delights for ever. 
\c 16  
\d (17) A prayer of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Hearken, O Lord \f + \fr 16:1  \fl Or, \ft to my righteous plea, etc. \f* of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not \add uttered\add* with deceitful lips. 
\q1
\v 2 Let my judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness. 
\q1
\v 3 Thou has proved mine heart; thou hast visited \add me\add* by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: \add I am purposed\add* that my mouth shall not speak \add amiss\add*. 
\q1
\v 4 As for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have \f + \fr 16:4  \fl Lit. \ft I have observed hard ways. \f* guarded \add myself from\add* hard ways. 
\q1
\v 5 Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip not. 
\q1
\v 6 I have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words. 
\q1
\v 7 Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy wings, 
\q1
\v 9 from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul. 
\q1
\v 10 They have enclosed \add themselves with\add* their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. 
\q1
\v 11 They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes \add so as\add* to bow them down to the ground. 
\q1
\v 12 They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret \add places\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: \add draw\add* thy sword,

\q1
\v 1 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; \add he is\add* my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper. 
\q1
\v 3 I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from mine enemies. 
\q1
\v 4 The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. 
\q1
\v 5 The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me. 
\q1
\v 6 And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, \add even\add* into his ears. 
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them. 
\q1
\v 8 There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. 
\q1
\v 9 And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. 
\q1
\v 10 And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. 
\q1
\v 11 And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, \add even\add* dark water in the clouds of the air. 
\q1
\v 12 At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. 
\q1
\v 14 And he sent forth \add his\add* weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them. 
\q1
\v 15 And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath. 
\q1
\v 16 He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters. 
\q1
\v 17 He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are stronger than I. 
\q1
\v 18 They prevented me in the day of mine affliction: but the Lord was my stay against \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 19 And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. 
\q1
\v 20 And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me. 
\q1
\v 21 For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\q1
\v 22 For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me. 
\q1
\v 23 And I shall be blameless with hem, and shall keep myself from mine iniquity. 
\q1
\v 24 And the Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes. 
\q1
\v 25 With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent. 
\q1
\v 26 And with the excellent \add man\add* thou wilt be excellent; and with the perverse thou wilt shew frowardness. 
\q1
\v 27 For thou wilt save the lowly people, and wilt humble the eyes of the proud. 
\q1
\v 28 For thou, O Lord, wilt light my lamp: my God, thou wilt lighten my darkness. 
\q1
\v 29 For by thee shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. 
\q1
\v 30  \add As for\add* my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him. 
\q1
\v 31 For who is God but the Lord? and who is a God except our God? 
\q1
\v 32  \add It is\add* God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: 
\q1
\v 33 who strengthens my feet as hart's feet, and sets me upon high places. 
\q1
\v 34 He instructs my hands for war: and thou hast made my arms \add as\add* a brazen bow. 
\q1
\v 35 And thou hast made me \f + \fr 17:35  \fl Gr. \ft the protection of. \f* secure in my salvation: and thy right hand has helped me, and thy correction has upheld me to the end; yea, thy correction itself shall instruct me. 
\q1
\v 36 Thou has made room for my goings under me, and by footsteps did not fail. 
\q1
\v 37 I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed. 
\q1
\v 38 I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet. 
\q1
\v 39 For thou hast girded me with strength for war: thou hast beaten down under me all that rose up against me. 
\q1
\v 40 And thou has made mine enemies turn their backs before me; and thou hast destroyed them that hated me. 
\q1
\v 41 They cried, but there was no deliverer: \add even\add* to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them. 
\q1
\v 42 I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind. 
\q1
\v 43 Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people: thou shalt make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me,

\v 44 at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: the strange children \f + \fr 17:44  \fl Or, \ft feigned obedience. \f* lied to me.

\v 2 Thou hast granted him the desire of his soul, and hast not withheld from him the request of his lips. Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 For thou hast prevented him with blessings of goodness: thou has set upon his head a crown of precious stone.

\v 4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 5 His glory is great in thy salvation: thou wilt crown him with glory and majesty.

\q1
\v 3 O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from Hades, thou hast delivered me from \add among\add* them that go down to the pit. 
\q1
\v 4 Sing to the Lord, ye his saints, and give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness.

\v 5 For anger is in his wrath, but life in his favour: weeping shall tarry for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning. 
\q1
\v 6 And I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 
\q1
\v 7 O Lord, in thy good pleasure thou didst add strength to my beauty: but thou didst turn away thy face, and I was troubled. 
\q1
\v 8 To thee, O Lord, will I cry; and to my God will I make supplication. 
\q1
\v 9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to thee? or shall it declare thy truth? 
\q1
\v 10 The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; the Lord is become my helper.

\v 11 Thou hast turned my mourning into joy for me: thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

\v 1 O Lord, I have hoped in thee; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness and rescue me.

\v 2 Incline thine ear to me; make haste to rescue me: be thou to me for a protecting God, and for a house of refuge to save me. 
\q1
\v 3 For thou art my strength and my refuge; and thou shalt guide me for thy name's sake, and maintain me. 
\q1
\v 4 Thou shalt bring me out of the snare which they have hidden for me; for thou, O Lord, art my defender. 
\q1
\v 5 Into thine hands I will commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou has hated them that idly persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 7 I will exult and be glad in thy mercy: for thou hast looked upon mine affliction; thou hast saved my soul from distresses. 
\q1
\v 8 And thou hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a wide place. 
\q1
\v 9 Pity me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with indignation, my soul and by belly. 
\q1
\v 10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled. 
\q1
\v 11 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me. 
\q1
\v 12 I have been forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am become as a broken vessel. 
\q1
\v 13 For I heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life. 
\q1
\v 14 But I hoped in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. 
\q1
\v 15 My lots are in thy hands: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,

\v 17 O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to Hades. 
\q1
\v 18 Let the deceitful lips become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn.

\v 19 How abundant is the multitude of thy goodness, O Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! thou hast wrought \add it\add* out for them that hope on thee, in the presence of the sons of men. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou wilt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the vexation of man: thou wilt screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. 
\q1
\v 21 Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city. 
\q1
\v 22 But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to thee. 
\q1
\v 23 Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders \add a reward\add* to them that deal very proudly.

\v 5 Let them be as dust before the wind, and an angel of the Lord afflicting them. 
\q1
\v 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, and an angel of the Lord persecuting them. 
\q1
\v 7 For without cause they have hid for me their destructive snare: without a cause they have reproached my soul.

\v 8 Let a snare which they know not come upon them; and the gin which they hid take them; and let them fall into the very same snare. 
\q1
\v 9 But my soul shall exult in the Lord: it shall delight in his salvation.

\v 10 All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like to thee? delivering the poor out of the hand of them that are stronger than he, yea, the poor and needy one from them that spoil him. 
\q1
\v 11 Unjust witnesses arose, and asked me of things I new not.

\q1
\v 3 The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is not inclined to understand \add how\add* to do good. 
\q1
\v 4 He devises iniquity on his bed; he gives himself to every evil way; and does not abhor evil. 
\q1
\v 5 O Lord, thy mercy is in the heaven; and thy truth \add reaches\add* to the clouds. 
\q1
\v 6 Thy righteousness is as the \f + \fr 35:6  \fl Or, \ft vast mountains. \f* mountains of God, thy judgments are as a great deep: O Lord, thou wilt preserve men and beasts.

\q1
\v 8 They shall be \f + \fr 35:8  \fl Gr. \ft intoxicated. \f* fully satisfied with the fatness of thine house; and thou shalt cause them to drink of the full stream of thy delights. 
\q1
\v 9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light we shall see light. 
\q1
\v 10 Extend thy mercy to them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners move me.

\v 12 There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.

\d (37) \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity. 
\q1
\v 2 For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs. 
\q1
\v 3 Hope in the Lord, and do good; and dwell on the land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it. 
\q1
\v 4 Delight \add thyself\add* in the Lord; and he shall grant thee the requests of thine heart. 
\q1
\v 5 Disclose thy way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring \add it\add* to pass. 
\q1
\v 6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day. 
\q1
\v 7 Submit thyself to the Lord, and supplicate him: fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds. 
\q1
\v 8 ease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil. 
\q1
\v 9 For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land. 
\q1
\v 10 And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight \add themselves\add* in the abundance of peace. 
\q1
\v 12 The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him. 
\q1
\v 13 But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come. 
\q1
\v 14 Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, \add and\add* to slay the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 15 Let their sword enter into their \add own\add* heart, and their bows be broken. 
\q1
\v 16 A little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners. 
\q1
\v 17 For the arms of sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous. 
\q1
\v 18 The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
\q1
\v 19 They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be satisfied. 
\q1
\v 20 For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke. 
\q1
\v 21 The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives. 
\q1
\v 22 For they that bless him shall inherit the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed. 
\q1
\v 23 The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way. 
\q1
\v 24 When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand. 
\q1
\v 25 I was \add once\add* young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread. 
\q1
\v 26 He is merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be \f + \fr 36:26  \fl Gr. \ft for a blessing. \f* blessed. 
\q1
\v 27 Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for ever. 
\q1
\v 28 For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless shall be \f + \fr 36:28  \fl Or, \ft cleared in judgement. \f* avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. 
\q1
\v 29 But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever. 
\q1
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, and his tongue will speak of judgment. 
\q1
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall not \f + \fr 36:31  \fl Gr. \ft be tripped up, or supplanted. \f* slide. 
\q1
\v 32 The sinner watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him. 
\q1
\v 33 But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him when he is judged. 
\q1
\v 34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are destroyed, thou shalt see \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 35 I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus. 
\q1
\v 36 Yet I passed by, and lo! he was not: and I sought him, but his place was not found. 
\q1
\v 37 Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the peaceable man. 
\q1
\v 38 But the transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. 
\q1
\v 39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is their defender in the time of affliction. 
\q1
\v 40 And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: and he shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in him.

\v 2 For thy weapons are fixed in me, and thou hast pressed thy hand heavily upon me. 
\q1
\v 3 For there is no health in my flesh because of thine anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins. 
\q1
\v 4 For my transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden. 
\q1
\v 5 My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. 
\q1
\v 6 I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day.

\v 7 For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh. 
\q1
\v 8 I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart. 
\q1
\v 9 But all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidden from thee. 
\q1
\v 10 My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me.

\v 11 My friends and my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off. 
\q1
\v 12 While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day. 
\q1
\v 13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. 
\q1
\v 14 And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. 
\q1
\v 15 For I hoped in thee, O Lord: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
\q1
\v 16 For I said, Lest mine enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me. 
\q1
\v 17 For I am ready for \f + \fr 37:17  \fl Gr. \ft scourges. \f* plagues, and my grief is continually before me.

\q1
\v 20 They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness.

\q1
\v 2 I was dumb, and humbled myself, and kept silence from good \add words\add*; and my grief was renewed.

\v 5 Behold, thou hast made my days \f + \fr 38:5  \fl Alex. \ft a span long. \f* old; and my existence \add is\add* as nothing before thee: nay, every man living \add is\add* altogether vanity. Pause. 
\q1
\v 6 Surely man walks in a \f + \fr 38:6  \fl Gr. \ft image. \f* shadow; nay, he is disquieted in vain: he lays up treasures, and knows not for whom he shall gather them. 
\q1
\v 7 And now what \add is\add* my expectation? \add is it\add* not the Lord? and my ground \add of hope\add* is with thee. Pause. 
\q1
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: thou hast made me a reproach to the foolish. 
\q1
\v 9 I was \f + \fr 38:9  \fl Gr. \ft made dumb. \f* dumb, and opened not my mouth; for thou art he that made me. 
\q1
\v 10 Remove thy scourges from me: I have fainted by reason of the strength of thine hand. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou chastenest man with rebukes for iniquity, and thou makest his life to consume away like a spider's web; nay, every man is disquieted in vain. Pause. 
\q1
\v 12 O Lord, hearken to my prayer and my supplication: attend to my tears: be not silent, for I am a sojourner in the land, and a stranger, as all my fathers \add were\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 Spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I depart, and be no more. 
\c 39  
\d (40) For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 I waited patiently for the Lord; and he attended to me, and hearkened to my supplication. 
\q1
\v 2 And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright. 
\q1
\v 3 And he put a new song into my mouth, \add even\add* a hymn to our God: many shall see \add it\add*, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 4 Blessed \add is\add* the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and \add who\add* has not regarded vanities and false frenzies. 
\q1
\v 5 O Lord my God, thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is none who shall be likened to thee: I declared and spoke \add of them\add*: they exceeded number. 
\q1
\v 6  \x + \xo 39:6  \xt Heb 10. 5,6 \x* Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me: whole-burnt-offering and \add sacrifice\add* for sin thou didst not require.

\v 7 Then I said, Behold, I \f + \fr 39:7  \fl Or, \ft am come. \f* come: in the volume of the book it is written concerning me, 
\q1
\v 8 I desired to do thy will, O my God, and thy law in the midst of mine heart. 
\q1
\v 9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, thou knowest my righteousness. 
\q1
\v 10 I have not hid thy truth within my heart, and I have declared thy salvation; I have not hid thy mercy and thy truth from the great congregation. 
\q1
\v 11 But thou, Lord, remove not thy compassion far from me; thy mercy and thy truth have helped me continually. 
\q1
\v 12 For innumerable evils have encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me. 
\q1
\v 13 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw nigh to help me. 
\q1
\v 14 Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to shame. 
\q1
\v 15 Let those that say to me, Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward. 
\q1
\v 16 Let all those that seek thee, O Lord, exult and rejoice in thee; and let them that love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified. 
\q1
\v 17 But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; thou art my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not. 
\c 40

\q1
\v 2 May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy. 
\q1
\v 3 May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast made all his bed in his sickness. 
\q1
\v 4 I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 
\q1
\v 5 Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, \add saying\add*, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
\q1
\v 6 And if he came to see \add me\add*, his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner. 
\q1
\v 7 All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt. 
\q1
\v 8 They denounced a wicked word against me, \add saying\add*, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again? 
\q1
\v 9 For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, \x + \xo 40:9  \xt John 13. 18. \x* who ate my bread, lifted up \add his\add* heel against me. 
\q1
\v 10 But thou, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. 
\q1
\v 11 By this I know that thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me.

\q1
\v 1 As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for thee, O God.

\v 2 My soul has thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
\q1
\v 3 My tears have been bread to me day and night, while they daily said to me, Where is thy God? 
\q1
\v 4 I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, for I will go to the place of thy wondrous tabernacle, \add even\add* to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival. \f + \fr 41:4  \ft See \fl Appendix, \ft which has: There are several difficulties connected with this passage. In the first place it seems evident that the LXX. read בסך, and the English translators בסר, or something similar. The Hebrew Text (to which no קרי is appended) thus far favours the LXX.; who, however, appear to have read אררס as a part of ארר, and made an adjective of it. Again, τόπῳ has nothing immediately answering it in the Hebrew, and may be accounted for on the principle so often referred to of \fl double translation.\f* 
\q1
\v 5 Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; \add he is\add* the salvation of my countenance. 
\q1
\v 6 O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill.

\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the voice of thy cataracts: all thy billows and thy waves have gone over me.

\v 9 I will say to God, Thou art my helper; why hast thou forgotten me? wherefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses \add me\add*?

\d (43) A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause, against an ungodly nation: deliver me from the unjust and crafty man. 
\q1
\v 2 For thou, O God, art my strength: wherefore hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses \add me\add*? 
\q1
\v 3 Send forth thy light and thy truth: they have led me, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles.

\q1
\v 1 O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, the work which thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of old. 
\q1
\v 2 Thine hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the nations, and cast them out. 
\q1
\v 3 For they inherited not the land by their \add own\add* sword, and their \add own\add* arm did not deliver them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou wert well pleased in them. 
\q1
\v 4 Thou art indeed my King and my God, who commandest deliverances for Jacob. 
\q1
\v 5 In thee will we push down our enemies, and in thy name will we bring to nought them that rise up against us. 
\q1
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me. 
\q1
\v 7 For thou hast saved us from them that afflicted us, and hast put to shame them that hated us. 
\q1
\v 8 In God \f + \fr 43:8  \fl Gr. \ft will be praised etc. See Ps. 106. \f* will we make our boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. Pause. 
\q1
\v 9 But now thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and thou wilt not go forth with our hosts. 
\q1
\v 10 Thou hast turned us back before our enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou madest us as sheep for meat; and thou scatteredst us among the nations. 
\q1
\v 12 Thou hast sold thy people without price, and there was no profit by their exchange. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision them that are round about us. 
\q1
\v 14 Thou hast made us a proverb among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations. 
\q1
\v 15 All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, 
\q1
\v 16 because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger. 
\q1
\v 17 All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in thy covenant. 
\q1
\v 18 And our heart has not gone back; but thou hast turned aside our paths from thy way. 
\q1
\v 19 For thou hast laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. 
\q1
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out? 
\q1
\v 21 for he knows the secrets of the heart. 
\q1
\v 22  \x + \xo 43:22  \xt Rom 8. 36. \x* For, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter.

\q1
\v 24 Wherefore turnest thou thy face away, \add and\add* forgettest our poverty and our affliction? 
\q1
\v 25 For our soul has been brought down to the dust; our belly has cleaved to the earth.

\q1
\v 10 Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father's house.

\v 15 O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
\q1
\v 16 For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given \add it\add*: thou wilt not take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings.

\v 17 Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.

\v 1 Why dost thou, O mighty man, boast of iniquity in \add thy\add* mischief? All the day 
\q1
\v 2 thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit. 
\q1
\v 3 Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. Pause.

\v 4 Thou has loved all words of destruction, \add and\add* a deceitful tongue.

\v 5 Therefore may God destroy thee for ever, may he pluck thee up and utterly remove thee from \add thy\add* dwelling, and thy root from the land of the living. Pause.

\v 6 And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say,

\v 7 Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity. 
\q1
\v 8 But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore.

\q1
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted \add themselves\add*, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that does good.

\v 1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy might. 
\q1
\v 2 O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth.

\v 4 For lo! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul.

\v 5 He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy truth.

\v 3 because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were wrathfully angry with me. 
\q1
\v 4 My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me. 
\q1
\v 5 Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. 
\q1
\v 6 And I said, O that I had wings as \add those\add* of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest. 
\q1
\v 7 Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness. Pause.

\v 15 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of them. 
\q1
\v 16 I cried to God, and the Lord hearkened to me.

\v 17 Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known \add my wants\add*: and he shall hear my voice.

\v 2 Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day from the dawning of the day; for there are many warring against me.

\v 8 O God, I have declared my life to thee; thou has set my tears before thee, even according to thy promise.

\v 13 Let those that plot against my soul be ashamed and utterly fail: let those that seek my hurt be clothed with shame and dishonour. 
\q1
\v 14 But I will hope continually, and will praise thee more and more. 
\q1
\v 15 My mouth shall declare thy righteousness openly, \add and\add* thy salvation all the day; for I am not acquainted with the affairs \add of men\add*.

\v 17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, and until now will I declare thy wonders;

\v 1 How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart! 
\q1
\v 2 But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped.

\v 5 They are not in the troubles of \add other\add* men; and they shall not be scourged with \add other\add* men.

\v 7 Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention.

\v 8 They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily.

\q1
\v 1 I cried to the Lord with my voice, yea, my voice \add was addressed\add* to God; and he gave heed to me. 
\q1
\v 2 In the day of mine affliction I earnestly sought the Lord; \add even\add* with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted. 
\q1
\v 3 I remembered God, and rejoiced; I poured out my complaint, and my soul fainted. Pause. 
\q1
\v 4 All mine enemies set a watch \add against me\add*: I was troubled, and spoke not. 
\q1
\v 5 I considered the days of old, and remembered ancient years. 
\q1
\v 6 And I meditated; I communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit, \add saying\add*, 
\q1
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more? 
\q1
\v 8 Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever? 
\q1
\v 9 Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? Pause. 
\q1
\v 10 And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most High. 
\q1
\v 11 I remembered the works of the Lord; for I will remember thy wonders from the beginning. 
\q1
\v 12 And I will meditate on all thy works, and will consider thy doings. 
\q1
\v 13 O God, thy way is in the sanctuary; who is a great God as our God? 
\q1
\v 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders; thou hast made known thy power among the nations. 
\q1
\v 15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Pause. 
\q1
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and feared; and the depths were troubled. 
\q1
\v 17  \add There was\add* an abundant sound of waters: the clouds uttered a voice; for thine arrows went abroad. 
\q1
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder was abroad, and around thy lightnings appeared to the world; the earth trembled a quaked.

\v 19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps cannot be known.

\v 1 Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.

\q1
\v 3 All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us. 
\q1
\v 4 They were not hid from their children to a second generations; \add the fathers\add* declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought. 
\q1
\v 5 And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children: 
\q1
\v 6 that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children. 
\q1
\v 7 That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments. 
\q1
\v 8 That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not \f + \fr 77:8  \fl Or, \ft faithfully secured.\f* steadfast with God. 
\q1
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting \add with\add* the bow, turned \add back\add* in the day of battle. 
\q1
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law. 
\q1
\v 11 And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he \add had\add* shewed them; 
\q1
\v 12 the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. 
\q1
\v 13 He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as \add in\add* a bottle. 
\q1
\v 14 And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\q1
\v 15 he clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep. 
\q1
\v 16 And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers. 
\q1
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 18 And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for \add the desire of\add* their souls. 
\q1
\v 19 They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? 
\q1
\v 20 Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? 
\q1
\v 21 Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. 
\q1
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. 
\q1
\v 23 Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
\q1
\v 24 and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven. 
\q1
\v 25 Man ate angels' bread; \x + \xo 77:25  \xt Mat 6. 31. \x* he sent them provision to the full. 
\q1
\v 26 He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind. 
\q1
\v 27 And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. 
\q1
\v 28 And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. 
\q1
\v 29 So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. 
\q1
\v 30 They were not disappointed of their desire: \add but\add* when their food was yet in their mouth, 
\q1
\v 31 then the indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel. 
\q1
\v 32 In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles. 
\q1
\v 33 And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety. 
\q1
\v 34 When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God. 
\q1
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. 
\q1
\v 36 Yet they loved him \add only\add* with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 
\q1
\v 37 For their heart \add was\add* not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. 
\q1
\v 38 But he is compassionate, and will \f + \fr 77:38  \fl Gr. \ft be propitious, \fl or, \ft merciful to. \f* forgive their sins, and will not destroy \add them\add*: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger. 
\q1
\v 39 And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. 
\q1
\v 40 How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, \add and\add* anger him in a dry land! 
\q1
\v 41 Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
\q1
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. 
\q1
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes: 
\q1
\v 44 and had changed their rivers into blood; and their \f + \fr 77:44  \fl Gr. \ft rains, \fl or, \ft showers. \f* streams, that they should not drink. 
\q1
\v 45 He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them. 
\q1
\v 46 And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust. 
\q1
\v 47 He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost. 
\q1
\v 48 And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. 
\q1
\v 49 He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. 
\q1
\v 50 He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; 
\q1
\v 51 and smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham. 
\q1
\v 52 And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 53 And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. 
\q1
\v 54 And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. 
\q1
\v 55 And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies. 
\q1
\v 57 And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow. 
\q1
\v 58 And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\q1
\v 59 God heard and \f + \fr 77:59  \fl Lit. \ft overlooked them. See Acts 17. 30. \f* lightly regarded \add them\add*, and greatly despised Israel. 
\q1
\v 60 And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. 
\q1
\v 61 And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. 
\q1
\v 62 And he \f + \fr 77:62  \fl Gr. \ft shut up. \f* gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not. 
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. 
\q1
\v 65 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \add and\add* as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. 
\q1
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. 
\q1
\v 67 And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; 
\q1
\v 68 but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved. 
\q1
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary as \add the place\add* of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth. 
\q1
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep. 
\q1
\v 71 He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 72 So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of thy servants \add to be\add* food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of thy holy ones for the wild beasts of the earth.

\v 6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms which have not called upon thy name.

\v 8 O Lord our God, thou heardest them; O God, thou becamest propitious to them, though thou didst take vengeance on all their devices.

\v 1 A Psalm of David. I will sing to thee, O Lord, of mercy and judgment; I will sing a psalm, 
\q1
\v 2 and I will be wise in a blameless way. When wilt thou come to me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house. 
\q1
\v 3 I have not set before mine eyes any unlawful ting; I have hated transgressors. 
\q1
\v 4 A perverse heart has not cleaved to me; I have not known an evil man, forasmuch as he turns away from me. 
\q1
\v 5 Him that privily speaks against his neighbour, him have I driven from \add me\add*: he that is proud in look and insatiable in heart, —with him I have not eaten. 
\q1
\v 6 Mine eyes \add shall be\add* upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walked in a perfect way, the same ministered to me. 
\q1
\v 7 The proud doer dwelt not in the midst of my house; the unjust speaker prospered not in my sight. 
\q1
\v 8 Early did I slay all the sinners of the land, that I might destroy out of the city of the Lord all that work iniquity.

\d (102) A Prayer for the Poor; when he is deeply afflicted, and pours out his supplication before the Lord. 
\q1
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come to thee. 
\q1
\v 2 Turn not away thy face from me: in the day \add when\add* I am afflicted, incline thine ear to me: in the day \add when\add* I shall call upon thee, speedily hear me. 
\q1
\v 3 For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have been parched like a stick. 
\q1
\v 4 I am blighted like grass, and my heart is dried up; for I have forgotten to eat my bread. 
\q1
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bone has cleaved to my flesh. 
\q1
\v 6 I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; 
\q1
\v 7 I have become like an owl in a ruined house. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow dwelling alone on a roof. 
\q1
\v 8 All the day long mine enemies have reproached me; and they that praised me have sworn against me. 
\q1
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, and mingled my drink with weeping; 
\q1
\v 10 because of thine anger and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and dashed me down. 
\q1
\v 11 My days have declined like a shadow; and I am withered like grass. 
\q1
\v 12 But thou, Lord, endurest for ever, and thy memorial to generation and generation. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for \add it is\add* time to have mercy upon her, for the set time is come. 
\q1
\v 14 For thy servants have taken pleasure in her stones, and they shall pity her dust. 
\q1
\v 15 So the nations shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all kings thy glory. 
\q1
\v 16 For the Lord shall build up Sion, \f + \fr 101:16  \fl Or, \ft then shall be. \f* and shall appear in his glory. 
\q1
\v 17 He has had regard to the prayer of the lowly, and has not despised their petition. 
\q1
\v 18 Let this be written for another generation; and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord. 
\q1
\v 19 For he has looked out from the height of his sanctuary; the Lord looked upon the earth from heaven;

\v 20 to hear the groaning of the fettered ones, to loosen the sons of the slain; 
\q1
\v 21 to proclaim the name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
\q1
\v 22 when the people are gathered together, and the kings, to serve the Lord. 
\q1
\v 23 He answered him in the way of his strength: tell me the fewness of my days.

\q1
\v 5 who satisfies thy desire with good things: \add so that\add* thy youth shall be renewed like \add that\add* of the eagle. 
\q1
\v 6 The Lord executes mercy and judgment for all that are injured. 
\q1
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses, his will to the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 8 The Lord is compassionate and pitiful, long-suffering, and full of mercy. 
\q1
\v 9 He will not be always angry; neither will he be wrathful for ever. 
\q1
\v 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed us according to our iniquities. 
\q1
\v 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, the Lord has \add so\add* increased his mercy toward them that fear him. 
\q1
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, \add so far\add* has he removed our transgressions from us. 
\q1
\v 13 As a father pities \add his\add* children, the Lord pities them that fear him. 
\q1
\v 14 For he knows our frame: remember that we are dust. 
\q1
\v 15  \add As for\add* man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he flourish. 
\q1
\v 16 For the wind passes over it, and it shall not be; and it shall know its place no more.

\v 17 But the mercy of the Lord is from generation to generation upon them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;

\v 8 They go up to the mountains, and down to the plains, to the place which thou hast founded for them. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass, neither shall they turn again to cover the earth.

\v 10 He sends forth his fountains among the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains.

\v 12 By them shall the birds of the sky lodge: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of the rocks. 
\q1
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his chambers: the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
\q1
\v 14 He makes grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, to bring bread out of the earth; 
\q1
\v 15 and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengthens man's heart.

\q1
\v 19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou didst make darkness, and it was night; in it all the wild beasts of the forest will be abroad:

\v 22 The sun arises, and they shall be gathered together, and shall lie down in their dens.

\v 10 And he established it to Jacob for an ordinance, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant;

\v 9 And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness.

\v 10 And he saved them out of the hand of them that hated \add them\add*, and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy. 
\q1
\v 11 The water covered those that oppressed them: there was not one of them left.

\v 12 Then they believed his words, and celebrated his praise.

\v 13 They made haste, they forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel. 
\q1
\v 14 And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the dry \add land\add*.

\v 22 wondrous \add works\add* in the land of Cham, and terrible things at the Red Sea. 
\q1
\v 23 So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn \add him\add* away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them. 
\q1
\v 24 Moreover they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word.

\v 25 And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 26 So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the wilderness;

\v 27 and to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries. 
\q1
\v 28 They were joined also to Beelphegor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked him with their devices;

\q1
\v 34 They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them \add to destroy\add*;

\q1
\v 36 And they served their graven images; and it became an offence to them. 
\q1
\v 37 And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,

\v 42 Ands their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought down under their hands.

\v 17 He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him.

\q1
\v 30 I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him.
