\p
\v 1 And the word of YHWH=G came to Yonah=P the son of Amittai=P:
\v 2 Arise go to Nineveh=L the big city=LNineveh and proclaim against it=LNineveh because their=Qpeople_of_Nineveh wickedness has come up before me=GYHWH.
\v 3 And Yonah=P arose to flee to Tarshish=L from before YHWH=G and he=PYonah went down to Yafo=L and he=PYonah found a ship about to go to Tarshish=L and he=PYonah gave its fare and he=PYonah went down in it=Oa_ship to go with them to Tarshish=L from before YHWH=G.
\v 4 And YHWH=G threw a big wind to the sea and it was a big storm on the sea and the ship thought it would be broken.
\v 5 And the sailors were afraid and everyone cried for help to his gods/God and they=sailors/everyone threw the vessels which were on the ship into the sea to lighten from on them and Yonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship and he=PYonah had lain down and had fallen fast asleep.
\v 6 And the captain of the sailors came near to him=PYonah and he=captain said to him=PYonah: Why are you=PYonah sleeping? Arise call to your=PYonah God, perhaps this God=G will take notice of us and we will not perish.
\v 7 And they each said to his neighbour: Come and let us cast lots so that we may know in whom this evil is upon us and they cast lots and the lot fell on Yonah=P.
\v 8 And they said to him=PYonah: Please tell us why this evil is upon us. What is your=PYonah occupation? And from where do you=PYonah come? What is your=PYonah country? And of what people are you=PYonah?
\v 9 And he=PYonah said to them: I=PYonah am a Hebrew and I=PYonah fear YHWH=G the God=G of the heavens who made the sea and the land.
\v 10 And the men feared a big fear and they=Qthe_men said to him=PYonah: What have you=PYonah done because the men knew that he=PYonah was fleeing from before YHWH=G because he=PYonah had told them=Qthe_men.
\v 11 And they=Qthe_men said to him=PYonah: What will we=Qthe_men do to you=PYonah so that the sea will be calm for us=Qthe_men because the sea was going and storming.
\v 12 And he=PYonah said to them=Qthe_men: Pick me=PYonah up and throw me=PYonah into the sea so that the sea will be calm for you=Qthe_men because I=PYonah know that this big storm is upon you=Qthe_men because of me=PYonah.
\v 13 And the men rowed but they=Qthe_men were not able to return to the land because the sea was going and storming on them=Qthe_men/everyone.
\v 14 And they=Qthe_men called to YHWH=G and they=Qthe_men said: We beg you YHWH=G: please do not let us=Qthe_men perish by the life of {this man}=PYonah and do not put innocent blood on us=Qthe_men because you=GYHWH YHWH=G have done just as you=GYHWH pleased.
\v 15 And they=Qthe_men picked up Yonah=P and they=Qthe_men threw him=PYonah into the sea and the sea stood still from its=Othe_sea storming.
\v 16 And the men feared a big fear of YHWH=G and they=Qthe_men sacrificed a sacrifice to YHWH=G and they=Qthe_men vowed vows.
\v 17 \f + \fr 1.17 \ft This is actually 2:1 in the Hebrew.\f* And YHWH=G appointed a big fish to swallow Yonah=P and Yonah=P was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 \f + \fr 2.1 \ft In the Hebrew, this is verse 2, and so on for the rest of the chapter.\f*And Yonah prayed to YHWH=G his=PYonah God from the belly of the fish.
\v 2 And he=PYonah said: I=PYonah called to YHWH=G from my=PYonah distress and he=GYHWH answered me=PYonah; from the valley of Sheol I=PYonah cried_for_help—you=GYHWH heard my=PYonah voice.
\v 3 And you have thrown me=PYonah in the deep; in the heart of the seas and a river surrounds me=PYonah; all your breaking waves and your waves have passed over me=PYonah.
\v 4 And I=PYonah said: I=PYonah have been driven away from before your=GYHWH eyes nevertheless I=PYonah will again look toward the temple of your=GYHWH holiness.
\v 5 The waters encompassed me=PYonah up to the throat/soul; the deep surrounded me=PYonah; reeds wrapped around my=PYonah head.
\v 6 I=PYonah went down to extremities of mountains; the bars of the earth were behind me=PYonah forever; and you=GYHWH brought up my=PYonah life from the grave, YHWH=G my God.
\v 7 When my=PYonah life was fainting away on me=PYonah, I=PYonah remembered YHWH=G and my=PYonah prayer came to you=GYHWH in the temple of your=GYHWH holiness.
\v 8 Those who revere vanities of nothingness abandon their loyalty.
\v 9 And I=PYonah will sacrifice to you=GYHWH with a voice of thanksgiving; what I=PYonah have vowed I=PYonah will fulfill; rescue belongs to YHWH=G.
\v 10 And YHWH=G spoke and the fish vomited Yonah up on the dry_land.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And the word of YHWH=G came a second time to Yonah saying:
\v 2 Arise go to Nineveh=L the big city and proclaim to it the proclamation which I=GYHWH am speaking to you=PYonah.
\v 3 And Yonah arose and he=PYonah went to Nineveh=L according to the word of YHWH=G and Nineveh=L was a big city before god; a journey of three days.
\v 4 And Yonah began to go into the city a journey of one day and he=PYonah proclaimed and he=PYonah said: forty days yet and Nineveh=L will be overturned.
\v 5 And the people of Nineveh=L believed in God and they=Qthe_people_of_Nineveh declared a fast and they=Qthe_people_of_Nineveh wore sackcloth from their=Qthe_people_of_Nineveh great and up to their=Qthe_people_of_Nineveh insignificant.
\v 6 And the word reached the king of Nineveh=L and he=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh arose from his=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh seat and he=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh took off his=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh robe from on him=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh and he=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh covered him=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh with sackcloth and he=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh sat on the ashes.
\v 7 And he=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh had a proclamation made and he=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh said: In Nineveh=L by decree of the king=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh and his=Pthe_king_of_Nineveh great [people] saying: The people and the livestock, the cattle and the flocks, let them not taste anything, let them not graze and let them not drink water.
\v 8 And let them cover themselves with sacks, the people and the livestock, and let them cry out to God with strength and let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence which is in their=everyone palms.
\v 9 Who knows, God may turn and he=GGod may relent and turn from the heat of his=God anger and we will not perish.
\v 10 And the God saw their deeds that they turned from their evil way and the God relented over the evil which he=Gthe_God had said he=Gthe_God would do to them and he=Gthe_God didn't do it.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And it was a great displeasure displeasing to Yonah and it burned to him=PYonah.
\v 2 And he=PYonah said to YHWH=G: I=PYonah beg you=GYHWH YHWH=G, wasn't this my=PYonah word when I=PYonah was still in my=PYonah country? That's why I=PYonah fled to Tarshish the first time because I=PYonah knew that you=GYHWH are a gracious god and compassionate, long of anger and great of kindness and who relents over evil.
\v 3 And therefore YHWH=G, please take my=PYonah life from me=PYonah because my=PYonah death is better than my=PYonah life.
\v 4 And YHWH=G said: Does it burn/kindle_anger rightly to you=PYonah?
\v 5 And Yonah went out from {the city}=LNineveh and he=PYonah sat east of {the city}=LNineveh and he=PYonah made for himself a shelter there=Xeast_of_Nineveh and he=PYonah sat under it=a_shelter in the shade until he=PYonah would see what would be/happen in {the city}=LNineveh.
\v 6 And YHWH=G God appointed a plant and it went up over Yonah to be shade over his=PYonah head and to deliver him=PYonah from his distress and Yonah rejoiced a big joy over the plant.
\v 7 And God appointed a grub when the dawn of the next day came up and it=a_grub attacked the plant and it=the_plant withered.
\v 8 And it was/happened just as the sun arose and God appointed a hot east wind and the sun beat on the head of Yonah and he=PYonah was faint and he=PYonah asked for his=PYonah life to die and he=PYonah said: My=PYonah death is better than my=PYonah life.
\v 9 And God=G said to Yonah=P: Does it burn/kindle_anger rightly to you=PYonah over the plant? And he=PYonah said: It burns/kindles_anger rightly to me=PYonah up to death.
\v 10 And YHWH=G said, You=PYonah had compassion on the plant which you=PYonah had not laboured for and you=PYonah had not caused_it_to_grow, which was a son of a night and died a son of a night.
\v 11 And will I=GYHWH not have compassion on the big city Nineveh=L which has more than twelve times ten_thousand people in it who cannot distinguish between his_right_hand and his_left and many livestock.
