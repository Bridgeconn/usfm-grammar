\iot A QUICK LOOK AT THIS BOOK
\iq1 God our Savior showed us
\iq2 how good and kind he is.
\iq1 He saved us because
\iq2 of his mercy,
\iq1 and not because
\iq2 of any good things
\iq2 that we have done.

\ip However, he is more than a teacher, healer, or \w miracle\w*-worker. He is also the
Messiah, the Son of God, the Son of Man. These three titles express the first Christians'
understanding of who Jesus is.
\ili 1 \k The Messiah\k* is the one promised by God, the one who would come and free God's
people. By the time \bk The Gospel of Mark\bk* appeared, the title "Messiah" (in Greek,
"\w christ\w*") had become a proper name, so that the Gospel opens with "the Good News about
Jesus Christ" (and not "Jesus the Christ"). Peter's confession (8.29) marks a turning-point
in the ministry of Jesus. The title "\w son of  david\w* " (10.46-48) also identifies Jesus
as the Messiah, who would restore to Israel the power and glory it enjoyed under David's
reign (also 12.35-37).
\ili 2 \k The Son of God\k* is the title by which the heavenly voice addresses Jesus at his
baptism (1.11) and his transfiguration (9.7). And at Jesus' death the Roman officer confesses
that Jesus is the Son of God (15.39).
\ili 3 \k The Son of Man\k* is the title most often used of Jesus, and it appears only on the
lips of Jesus. This enigmatic title appears in \bk The Book of Daniel\bk* (Dan 7.13n), where
it is applied to the exalted figure to whom God gives universal dominion. In \bk Mark\bk* the
title is used of Jesus in three ways: the Son of Man acts with divine power (2.10, 28); he will
be rejected, will suffer and die (8.31; 9.9, 12, 31; 10.33-34, 45; 14.21, 41); he will return
in power and glory (8.38; 13.26; 14.62).
\ip The two endings to the Gospel, which are enclosed in brackets, are generally regarded
as written by someone other than the author of \bk Mark\bk*
