\s1 The Preaching of John the Baptist\x - \xo 3.0 \xta Compare with \xt Mk 1.1-8;
Lk 3.1-18; \xta and \xt Jn 1.19-28 \xta parallel passages.\x*
\v 1 This is the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. \f + \fr 1.1: \ft Some manuscripts do not have \fq the Son of God.\f*
\v 2 with the certain hope of everlasting life that God, who does not lie, promised before all the ages of time.

\v 5 For this purpose I left you in Crete, that you might set in order things not yet complete and ordain elders in every city as I directed you.

\s5
\v 6 An elder must be without blame, the husband of one wife, with faithful children not accused of reckless behavior or undisciplined.
\v 7 It is necessary for the overseer, as God's household manager, to be blameless. He must not be arrogant, not be easily angered, not addicted to wine, not a brawler, and not a greedy man.

\s5
\v 8 Instead, he should be hospitable and a friend of what is good. He must be sensible, righteous, godly, and self-controlled.
\v 9 И нарек ему имя: Ной, сказав: он утешит нас в работе нашей и в трудах рук
наших при \add возделывании\add* земли, которую проклял Господь.

\v 10 For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision.
\v 11 It is necessary to stop them. They are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach.

\s5
\v 12 One of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
\v 13 This statement is true. Therefore, correct them severely, so that they may be sound in the faith,
\v 14 not paying any attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of people who turn away from the truth.

\v 15 Adam \f + \fr 3.20: \fk Adam: \ft This name in Hebrew means “all human beings.”\f*
named his wife Eve, \f + \fr 3.20: \fk Eve: \ft This name sounds similar to the Hebrew
word for “living,” which is rendered in this context as “human beings.”\f* because she
was the mother of all human beings.
\v 16 And the \nd Lord\nd* God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam and his wife,
and he clothed them. \f ⸀ \fr 28,14 \ft υπο \fw B D 0148. 892\f* \f ° \fr 4,1 \fw B Δ 700\f*

truth: we shall not all die, but when the last trumpet sounds, we shall all be changed
in an instant, as quickly as the blinking of an eye. For when the trumpet sounds, the

\v 2 Teach older men to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance.

do not accuse anyone falsely; do not cheat; respect your father and your mother.’”
\v 10 to not steal from them, but instead to demonstrate all good faith, so that in every way they may bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior.

\s5
\v 11 For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all people.
\v 12 It trains us to reject godlessness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this age,
\v 13 while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.
