\p When the \nd Lord\nd* \f + \fr 2.4: \fk the \+nd Lord\+nd*: \ft Where the Hebrew text
has Yahweh, traditionally transliterated as Jehovah, this translation employs \+nd Lord\+nd*
with capital letters, following a usage which is widespread in English versions.\f* God made
the universe,
\v 5 there were no plants on the earth and no seeds had sprouted, because he had not sent
any rain, and there was no one to cultivate the land;
\v 14 That is why \bk The Book of the \+nd Lord\+nd*'s Battles\bk* speaks of “...the
town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,
\v 15 and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border
of Moab.”
