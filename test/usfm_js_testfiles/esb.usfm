\ms Fish and Fishing
\p In Jesus' time, fishing took place mostly on lake Galilee, because Jewish people
could not use many of the harbors along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, since these
harbors were often controlled by unfriendly neighbors. The most common fish in the Lake
of Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of Moses allowed people to eat any fish with
fins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to
be eaten (\xt Lev 11.9-12\xt*). Fish were also probably brought from Tyre and Sidon,
where they were dried and salted.
...
\p Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because the Greek
word for fish (\tl ichthus\tl*) consists of the first letters of the Greek words that
tell who Jesus is: \fig Christian Fish Image\fig*
\esbe
Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
