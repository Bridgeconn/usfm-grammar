\c 1
\p
\v 1 And the word of YHWH came to Yonah the son of Amittai:
\v 2 Arise go to Nineveh the big city and proclaim against it because their wickedness has come up before me.
\v 3 And Yonah arose to flee to Tarshish from before YHWH and he went down to Yafo and he found a ship about to go to Tarshish and he gave its fare and he went down in it to go with them to Tarshish from before YHWH.
\v 4 And YHWH threw a big wind to the sea and it was a big storm on the sea and the ship thought it would be broken.
\v 5 And the sailors were afraid and everyone cried for help to his gods/God and they threw the vessels which were on the ship into the sea to lighten from on them and Yonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship and he had lain down and had fallen fast asleep.
\v 6 And the captain of the sailors came near to him and he said to him: Why are you sleeping? Arise call to your God, perhaps this God will take notice of us and we will not perish.
\v 7 And they each said to his neighbour: Come and let us cast lots so that we may know in whom this evil is upon us and they cast lots and the lot fell on Yonah.
\v 8 And they said to him: Please tell us why this evil is upon us. What is your occupation? And from where do you come? What is your country? And of what people are you?
\v 9 And he said to them: I am a Hebrew and I fear YHWH the God of the heavens who made the sea and the land.
\v 10 And the men feared a big fear and they said to him: What have you done because the men knew that he was fleeing from before YHWH because he had told them.
\v 11 And they said to him: What will we do to you so that the sea will be calm for us because the sea was going and storming.
\v 12 And he said to them: Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that the sea will be calm for you because I know that this big storm is upon you because of me.
\v 13 And the men rowed but they were not able to return to the land because the sea was going and storming on them.
\v 14 And they called to YHWH and they said: We beg you YHWH: please do not let us perish by the life of this man and do not put innocent blood on us because you YHWH have done just as you pleased.
\v 15 And they picked up Yonah and they threw him into the sea and the sea stood still from its storming.
\v 16 And the men feared a big fear of YHWH and they sacrificed a sacrifice to YHWH and they vowed vows.
\v 17 \f + \fr 1.17 \ft This is actually 2:1 in the Hebrew.\f* And YHWH appointed a big fish to swallow Yonah and Yonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

\v 1 \f + \fr 2.1 \ft In the Hebrew, this is verse 2, and so on for the rest of the chapter.\f*And Yonah prayed to YHWH his God from the belly of the fish.
\v 2 And he said: I called to YHWH from my distress and he answered me; from the valley of Sheol I cried_for_help—you heard my voice.
\v 3 And you have thrown me in the deep; in the heart of the seas and a river surrounds me; all your breaking waves and your waves have passed over me.
\v 4 And I said: I have been driven away from before your eyes nevertheless I will again look toward the temple of your holiness.
\v 5 The waters encompassed me up to the throat/soul; the deep surrounded me; reeds wrapped around my head.
\v 6 I went down to extremities of mountains; the bars of the earth were behind me forever; and you brought up my life from the grave, YHWH my God.
\v 7 When my life was fainting away on me, I remembered YHWH and my prayer came to you in the temple of your holiness.
\v 8 Those who revere vanities of nothingness abandon their loyalty.
\v 9 And I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving; what I have vowed I will fulfill; rescue belongs to YHWH.
\v 10 And YHWH spoke and the fish vomited Yonah up on the dry_land.

\v 1 And the word of YHWH came a second time to Yonah saying:
\v 2 Arise go to Nineveh the big city and proclaim to it the proclamation which I am speaking to you.
\v 3 And Yonah arose and he went to Nineveh according to the word of YHWH and Nineveh was a big city before god; a journey of three days.
\v 4 And Yonah began to go into the city a journey of one day and he proclaimed and he said: forty days yet and Nineveh will be overturned.
\v 5 And the people of Nineveh believed in God and they declared a fast and they wore sackcloth from their great and up to their insignificant.
\v 6 And the word reached the king of Nineveh and he arose from his seat and he took off his robe from on him and he covered him with sackcloth and he sat on the ashes.
\v 7 And he had a proclamation made and he said: In Nineveh by decree of the king and his great [people] saying: The people and the livestock, the cattle and the flocks, let them not taste anything, let them not graze and let them not drink water.
\v 8 And let them cover themselves with sacks, the people and the livestock, and let them cry out to God with strength and let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence which is in their palms.
\v 9 Who knows, God may turn and he may relent and turn from the heat of his anger and we will not perish.
\v 10 And the God saw their deeds that they turned from their evil way and the God relented over the evil which he had said he would do to them and he didn't do it.

\v 1 And it was a great displeasure displeasing to Yonah and it burned to him.
\v 2 And he said to YHWH: I beg you YHWH, wasn't this my word when I was still in my country? That's why I fled to Tarshish the first time because I knew that you are a gracious god and compassionate, long of anger and great of kindness and who relents over evil.
\v 3 And therefore YHWH, please take my life from me because my death is better than my life.
\v 4 And YHWH said: Does it burn/kindle_anger rightly to you?
\v 5 And Yonah went out from the city and he sat east of the city and he made for himself a shelter there and he sat under it in the shade until he would see what would be/happen in the city.
\v 6 And YHWH God appointed a plant and it went up over Yonah to be shade over his head and to deliver him from his distress and Yonah rejoiced a big joy over the plant.
\v 7 And God appointed a grub when the dawn of the next day came up and it attacked the plant and it withered.
\v 8 And it was/happened just as the sun arose and God appointed a hot east wind and the sun beat on the head of Yonah and he was faint and he asked for his life to die and he said: My death is better than my life.
\v 9 And God said to Yonah: Does it burn/kindle_anger rightly to you over the plant? And he said: It burns/kindles_anger rightly to me up to death.
\v 10 And YHWH said, You had compassion on the plant which you had not laboured for and you had not caused_it_to_grow, which was a son of a night and died a son of a night.
\v 11 And will I not have compassion on the big city Nineveh which has more than twelve times ten_thousand people in it who cannot distinguish between his_right_hand and his_left and many livestock.
