The most common fish in the Lake of Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of Moses allowed people to eat any fish with fins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to be eaten (<char style="xt">Lev 11.9-12</char>). Fish were also probably brought from Tyre and Sidon, where they were dried and salted. ...</para><para style="p" >Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because the Greek word for fish (<char style="tl">ichthus</char>) consists of the first letters of the Greek words that tell who Jesus is: <figure style="fig">Christian Fish Image</figure></para></sidebar>
