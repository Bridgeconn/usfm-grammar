\v 5 Now I wish to remind you, although you know everything, that the Lord once saved a
people out of the land of Egypt, but that afterward he destroyed those who did not believe.
\v 6 And angels who did not keep to their own principality, but left their proper dwelling
placeâ€”God has kept them in everlasting chains in darkness for the judgment of the
great day.

\v 7 It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which in a similar way
gave themselves over to fornication and pursued unnatural desires. They were given as
examples of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
\v 8 Yet in the same way these also pollute their bodies in their dreams, and they reject
authority, and they say evil things about the glorious ones.
