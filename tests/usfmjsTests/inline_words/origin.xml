  <para style="ms">Jesus' Public Ministry in Galilee</para>
  <para style="mr">1.14--9.50</para>
  <para style="ip">Jesus returns to Galilee and does not go back to Judea until the close of his public ministry. There is no indication of how long his Galilean ministry lasted: only when he is back in Judea is a <char style="w">festival</char> mentioned (14.1). He spends much of his time in Capernaum (1.21; 2.1; 3.1, 20; 9.33) and other places around Lake Galilee (1.9; 2.13; 3.7; 4.1). Twice Jesus ventures out of Galilee: into the region of the Ten Towns (5.1-20) and Phoenicia (7.24-31). His actions and teachings soon arouse opposition from the religious leaders (2.6-7, 24; 3.6, 22; 7.1-13; 8.11-12), and before long he predicts his coming arrest, condemnation, and crucifixion (8.31; 9.30-31).</para>

  <para style="ip">Jesus' message is about the arrival of the <char style="w">kingdom of god</char>, which will happen soon. To prepare for it, the people need to repent (1.15). He immediately summons two pairs of fishermen brothers to be his followers and helpers.</para>
