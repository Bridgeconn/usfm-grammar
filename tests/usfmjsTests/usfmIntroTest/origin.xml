  <para style="ip">The opening words of <char style="bk">The Gospel according to Mark</char> tell its readers that the subject of this book is the Good News about Jesus Christ. With the coming of Jesus Christ, it announces, the time set by God to bring salvation to humankind has arrived (1.15). Though the book concentrates on his deeds and words, it is not a biography of Jesus of Nazareth. Only one year, or a little more, of Jesus' life appears to be recorded (chapters 1--10), and over one-third of the book (chapters 11--16) is taken up with the last week of Jesus in and near <char style="w">Jerusalem</char>. Nothing is said about his birth, childhood, home, or parents. When he first appears, unknown and unannounced, Jesus is a full-grown adult who comes to John the Baptist to be <char style="w">baptized</char> by him.</para>
  <para style="ip">The author's primary interest in writing is religious. The Gospel is written "from <char style="w">faith</char> to faith".</para>
  <para style="is1">The Story</para>
  <para style="ip">
    <char style="bk">Mark's</char> story of Jesus is told quickly and with an abundance of details that enhance its dramatic impact. Jesus appears suddenly in Judea, where he joins those who are being baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist. Just as suddenly, he returns to Galilee, where he proclaims the message that the <char style="w">kingdom of god</char> is about to arrive.</para>
  <para style="ip">However, he is more than a teacher, healer, or <char style="w">miracle</char>-worker. He is also the Messiah, the Son of God, the Son of Man. These three titles express the first Christians' understanding of who Jesus is.</para>
  <para style="ili">1 <char style="k">The Messiah</char> is the one promised by God, the one who would come and free God's people. By the time <char style="bk">The Gospel of Mark</char> appeared, the title "Messiah" (in Greek, "<char style="w">christ</char>") had become a proper name, so that the Gospel opens with "the Good News about Jesus Christ" (and not "Jesus the Christ"). Peter's confession (8.29) marks a turning-point in the ministry of Jesus. The title "<char style="w">son of david</char> " (10.46-48) also identifies Jesus as the Messiah, who would restore to Israel the power and glory it enjoyed under David's reign (also 12.35-37).</para>
  <para style="ili">2 <char style="k">The Son of God</char> is the title by which the heavenly voice addresses Jesus at his baptism (1.11) and his transfiguration (9.7). And at Jesus' death the Roman officer confesses that Jesus is the Son of God (15.39).</para>
  <para style="ili">3 <char style="k">The Son of Man</char> is the title most often used of Jesus, and it appears only on the lips of Jesus. This enigmatic title appears in <char style="bk">The Book of Daniel</char> (Dan 7.13n), where it is applied to the exalted figure to whom God gives universal dominion. In <char style="bk">Mark</char> the title is used of Jesus in three ways: the Son of Man acts with divine power (2.10, 28); he will be rejected, will suffer and die (8.31; 9.9, 12, 31; 10.33-34, 45; 14.21, 41); he will return in power and glory (8.38; 13.26; 14.62).</para>

  <para style="ip">Jesus returns to Galilee and does not go back to Judea until the close of his public ministry. There is no indication of how long his Galilean ministry lasted: only when he is back in Judea is a <char style="w">festival </char> mentioned (14.1). He spends much of his time in Capernaum (1.21; 2.1; 3.1, 20; 9.33) and other places around Lake Galilee (1.9; 2.13; 3.7; 4.1). Twice Jesus ventures out of Galilee: into the region of the Ten Towns (5.1-20) and Phoenicia (7.24-31). His actions and teachings soon arouse opposition from the religious leaders (2.6-7, 24; 3.6, 22; 7.1-13; 8.11-12), and before long he predicts his coming arrest, condemnation, and crucifixion (8.31; 9.30-31).</para>
