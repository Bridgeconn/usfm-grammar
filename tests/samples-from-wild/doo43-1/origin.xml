So they are without excuse. <verse eid="ROM 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 1:21" />This is because, although they knew about God, they did not glorify him as God, nor did they give him thanks.

  <para style="s5" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 2:13" />For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be justified. <verse eid="ROM 2:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 2:14" />For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, they are a law to themselves, although they do not have the law.<verse eid="ROM 2:14" /></para>

  <para style="p">
