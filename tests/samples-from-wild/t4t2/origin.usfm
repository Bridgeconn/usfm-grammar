\imt1 Book One 
\c 1  
\s1 The people God is pleased with 
\q1
\v 1  \add God\add* is pleased with those who do not do what [MET] wicked people advise them to do, 
\q2 and who do not imitate the behavior of [MET]sinful people, 
\q1 and who do not join in with people who ◄ridicule/sneer at► \add God\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that he has instructed/taught us to do. 
\q2 They read and think about Yahweh's requirements, day and night. 
\q1
\v 3 They \add constantly produce/do things that please God\add* 
\q2 just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year. 
\q1 \add Like\add* trees that never wither, 
\q2 they succeed in everything that they do. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 But wicked people are not like that! 
\q2 Wicked people are \add as worthless as\add* chaff 
\q2 that is blown away by the wind. 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore, wicked people ◄will not be acquitted/will be condemned► [LIT] when \add God\add* judges people, 
\q2 and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when \add God\add* gathers righteous people together, 
\q1
\v 6 because he guides and protects righteous people, 
\q2 but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed/punished \add by God forever\add*. 
\c 2  
\q1
\v 1 ◄Why do the \add leaders of\add* nations rage \add against God\add*?/It is foolish for the nations to be angry \add with God\add* ► [RHQ]. 
\q2 ◄Why do people plan to rebel \add against God\add* even though it is in vain?/It is useless for people to plan to rebel \add against God\add*► [RHQ]! 
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the nations prepare to revolt; 
\q2 the rulers plot together \add to fight\add* against Yahweh and against his chosen king. 
\q1
\v 3 They shout, “We should free ourselves from their control [MET]; 
\q2 we should not let them rule over us any longer!” 
\b
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh, the one who sits \add on his throne\add* in heaven, laughs \add at them\add*; 
\q2 he ridicules those rulers. 
\q1
\v 5 Then, because he is angry with them, he rebukes them. 
\q2 He causes them to be terrified when \add they realize\add* that he will furiously punish them. 
\q1
\v 6  \add Yahweh says\add*, “I have installed my king on Zion, my sacred hill \add in Jerusalem\add*.” 
\q1
\v 7  \add And his king says\add*, “I will proclaim what Yahweh has decreed. 
\q1 He said to me, ‘ \add It is as though\add* you are my son; 
\q2 today I have declared to everyone that \add it is as though\add* [MET] I am your father. 
\q1
\v 8 Ask me to give you the nations, 
\q2 so that they belong to you \add to rule over them permanently\add*, 
\q2 and I will give them to you. 
\q1 \add Even\add* the most remote nations will be yours. 
\q1
\v 9 You will defeat them completely [MET]; 
\q2 you will \add destroy them like people\add* smash a clay pot with an iron rod [SIM].’” 
\b
\q1
\v 10 So then, you kings and other rulers on the earth, act wisely! 
\q2 \add Heed what Yahweh is\add* warning you! 
\q1
\v 11 Serve Yahweh, fervently revering him; 
\q2 Rejoice \add about what he has done for you\add*, but tremble before him! 
\q1
\v 12 Bow down humbly before his son! 
\q2 If you do not do that, Yahweh will be angry, 
\q2 and he will suddenly get rid of you. 
\q1 Do not forget that he can very quickly show that he is very angry! 
\q2 But he is very pleased with all those who request him to protect them [MET]. 
\c 3  
\s1 A psalm written by David when he fled from his son Absalom 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I have many enemies [DOU]! 
\q2 There are many people who oppose/rebel against me. 
\q1
\v 2 Many people are saying about me, 
\q2 “God will \add certainly\add* not help him!” 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q2
\v 3 But Yahweh, you are like a shield \add that protects me\add* [MET]. 
\q1 You greatly honor me, and you encourage me (OR, enable me to triumph over my enemies) [IDM]. 
\q1
\v 4 I cry out to you, Yahweh, 
\q2 and you answer me from \add Zion\add*, your sacred hill. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 5  \add At night\add* I lie down and sleep, and I awake \add in the morning feeling good/refreshed\add* 
\q2 because you, Yahweh, ◄take care of/protect► me \add all during the night\add*. 
\q1
\v 6 There may be thousands of \add enemy\add* soldiers who surround me, 
\q2 but I am not afraid. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, arise! 
\q2 My God, \add come and\add* rescue me \add again\add*! 
\q1 You \add insult\add* my enemies by slapping them on their cheeks; 
\q2 \add when you strike them\add*, you break their teeth, 
\q2 \add with the result that they cannot hurt anyone\add* [MET]. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, you are the one who saves your people \add from their enemies\add*. 
\q2 Yahweh, bless your people! 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\c 4  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments 
\q1
\v 1 God, answer me when I pray to you. 
\q2 You are the one who vindicates me; 
\q1 Rescue me from things that distress me. 
\q2 Act mercifully toward me, and listen to me while I pray. 
\q1
\v 2 How long will you people cause me to be disgraced instead of honoring me [RHQ]? 
\q2 You \add people\add* love to falsely accuse me. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 3 All those who are loyal to Yahweh, 
\q2 he has chosen them to belong to him. 
\q1 Yahweh listens to me when I pray to him. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 When you people get angry, do not \add allow your anger to control you and cause you to\add* sin. 
\q1 While you lie on your bed, 
\q2 silently examine what you are thinking g. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 5 Also, offer to Yahweh the proper sacrifices, 
\q2 and continue trusting in him. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Some people ask, “Who will allow good things to happen to us?” 
\q2 \add But I say\add*, “Yahweh, continue to act kindly toward us. 
\q1
\v 7 You have made me very happy; 
\q2 I am happier than people who have harvested a great amount of grain and grapes. 
\q1
\v 8 I can lie down \add at night\add* and sleep soundly 
\q2 because \add I know that\add* you, Yahweh, will keep me safe.” 
\c 5  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by playing flutes 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray! 
\q2 Pay attention to me when I am groaning \add because I am suffering very much\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 You are my King and my God. 
\q1 When I call to you to ask you to help me, listen to me, 
\q2 because you are the one to whom I pray. 
\q1
\v 3 Listen to me when I pray to you \add each\add* morning, 
\q2 and I wait for you to reply. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 You are not a god who is pleased with wicked people; 
\q2 you do not ◄associate with/invite into your house► \add those who do what is\add* evil. 
\q1
\v 5 You do not allow those who are very proud to come to you to worship you. 
\q2 You hate all those who do evil things. 
\q1
\v 6 You get rid of liars, 
\q2 and you despise those who murder \add others\add* and those who deceive \add others\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, because you love me so much and so faithfully, 
\q2 I come into your temple. 
\q1 I revere you greatly, 
\q2 and I bow down to worship you at your sacred temple. 
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, because you act righteously toward me, 
\q2 show me what is right for me to do. 
\q1 Because I have many enemies, 
\q2 show me clearly what you want me to do. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 My enemies never say what is true; 
\q2 they just want to destroy \add others\add*. 
\q1 The things that they say [MTY] are \add as foul as\add* an open grave \add where a corpse is decaying\add*. 
\q2 They use their tongues to tell lies. 
\q1
\v 10 O God, declare that they are guilty [MTY] \add and punish them\add*. 
\q2 Cause them to experience the same disasters/troubles that they plan to cause to happen to others. 
\q1 Get rid of them because they have committed many sins, 
\q2 and they have rebelled against you. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 But cause that all those who go to you to be protected will rejoice; 
\q2 cause them to sing joyfully to you forever. 
\q1 Protect those who love you [MTY]; 
\q2 they are truly happy because ◄of what you \add do for them/they belong to\add* you►. 
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, you always bless those who act righteously; 
\q2 you protect them like a \add soldier is protected by his\add* shield [SIM]. 
\c 6  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir leader, to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, do not punish me when you are angry \add with me\add*; 
\q2 Do not even rebuke/scold me \add when you are angry\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh, be kind to me and heal me because I have become weak. 
\q2 My body [SYN] shakes because I am experiencing much pain. 
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, I am greatly distressed. 
\q2 How long ◄ \add must I endure this/will it be before you help me\add*► [RHQ]? 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh, please come and rescue me. 
\q2 Save me because you faithfully love me. 
\q1
\v 5 I will not be able to praise you after I die [RHQ]; 
\q2 No one in the place of the dead praises you. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 I am exhausted/groan \add from my pain\add*. 
\q2 At night I cry very much, with the result that my bed and my pillow become wet from my tears. 
\q1
\v 7 My tears blur my eyes so much that I cannot see well. 
\q2 My eyes have become weak because my enemies \add have caused me to cry constantly\add*. 
\q1
\v 8 You people who do evil things, get away from me! 
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh heard me when I was crying and called out to him \add to help me\add*, 
\q2 and he will answer my prayer. 
\q1
\v 10  \add When that happens\add*, all my enemies will be ashamed, 
\q2 and they will \add also\add* be terrified. 
\q1 They will get away \add from me\add* and suddenly \add leave me\add* 
\q2 because they will be disgraced. 
\c 7  
\s1 A psalm that David sang to Yahweh because of David's enemy, Cush 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh my God, I come to you to protect me. 
\q2 Rescue me, save me from all those who are pursuing me \add in order to harm me\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 If you do not do that, they will tear me into pieces 
\q2 like a lion does \add when it attacks the animals it wants to kill\add*, 
\q2 and no one will save me \add from them\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh my God, if I have done anything that is wrong, 
\q2
\v 4 if I have done evil to some friend who did good things to me, 
\q2 or if, for no good reason, I have spared (OR, acted violently toward) those who were my enemies, 
\q1
\v 5 allow my enemies to pursue me and capture me. 
\q1 Allow them to trample me into the ground 
\q2 and leave me [SYN] \add lying dead\add* in the dirt. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 6 But Yahweh, because you are \add very\add* angry \add with those who pursue me\add*, 
\q2 arise and attack/defeat my enemies who are furiously/angrily \add attacking me\add* 
\q1 Do to them what is just! 
\q1
\v 7 Gather around you the people of \add all\add* nations, 
\q2 and rule them from where you are in heaven [MTY]. 
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, judge the people of \add all\add* nations! 
\q2 And, Yahweh, show that I have done nothing that is wrong. 
\q1
\v 9 God, you know what every person is thinking, 
\q2 and because you are righteous, you \add always\add* do what is just/right. 
\q1 \add So now\add* stop evil people from doing wicked \add deeds\add*, 
\q2 and defend \add all of us who are\add* righteous! 
\b
\q1
\v 10 God, you protect me like a shield \add protects soldiers\add* [MET]; 
\q2 you protect all those who are righteous in their inner being. 
\q1
\v 11 You judge \add everyone\add* correctly, 
\q2 and every day you punish \add wicked people\add*. 
\q1
\v 12 Whenever your enemies do not ◄repent/change their behavior►, 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* [MET] you sharpen your sword and put a string on your bow \add to get ready to kill them\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 You are preparing your weapons that kill those whom they strike; 
\q2 the arrows that you will shoot have flaming tips. 
\q1
\v 14 Wicked people tell lies, 
\q2 and they think that they surely will be able to do [MET] the evil things that they are planning to do 
\q2 \add just as surely as\add* a pregnant woman \add knows that she is going to give birth to a child\add* [MET]. 
\q1
\v 15 But when they dig a deep pit \add to trap others\add*, 
\q2 they themselves will fall into it. 
\q1
\v 16 They themselves will experience the trouble that they want to cause others to have; 
\q2 they will hurt themselves by the violent things that they want to do to others. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 I praise Yahweh because he \add always acts\add* righteously/justly; 
\q2 I sing to praise Yahweh, the one who is much greater than any other god. 
\c 8  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, our Lord, people all over the world know that you [MTY] are very great! 
\q2 Your glory reaches up higher than the heavens! 
\q1
\v 2 You have taught little children and infants to praise you; 
\q2 they cause your enemies and those who try to ◄get revenge on/get rid of► you to be silent. 
\q1
\v 3 When I look up at the sky \add at night\add*, 
\q2 and see the things that you have made— 
\q2 the moon and the stars that you have set in place— 
\q1
\v 4 it is amazing \add to me\add* that [RHQ] you think about people, 
\q2 that you are concerned about \add us\add* humans! 
\q1
\v 5 You made the angels in heaven to be only a little more important than we are; 
\q2 you caused us to be like kings [MET] and you gave us splendor and honor [DOU]! 
\q1
\v 6 You put us in charge of everything that you made; 
\q2 you gave us authority over all things— 
\q1
\v 7 the sheep and the cattle, 
\q2 and even the wild animals, 
\q1
\v 8 the birds, the fish, 
\q2 and everything \add else\add* that swims in the seas. 
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh, our Lord, 
\q2 people all over the world know that you [MTY] are very great! 
\c 9  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ❛The death of my son❜ 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I will praise you with all of my inner being. 
\q2 I will tell \add others\add* about all the wonderful things that you have done. 
\q1
\v 2 I will sing to celebrate what you [MTY], who are much greater than all other gods, \add have done\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 When my enemies realize \add that you are very powerful\add*, 
\q2 they stumble, and then they are killed. 
\q1
\v 4 You sat on your throne to judge people, 
\q2 and you have judged fairly/justly concerning me. 
\q1
\v 5 You rebuked the \add people of other\add* nations 
\q2 and you have gotten rid of the wicked people; 
\q2 you have erased their names forever. 
\q1
\v 6 Our enemies have disappeared; 
\q2 you destroyed their cities, 
\q2 and people do not even remember them anymore. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 But Yahweh rules forever. 
\q2 He judges \add people while he sits\add* on his throne to judge people, 
\q1
\v 8 and he will judge \add all the people in\add* [SYN] the world justly; 
\q2 he will judge the people \add of all nations\add* fairly [DOU]. 
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh will be a refuge for those who are oppressed; 
\q2 \add yes, he will be like\add* a shelter for them when they have trouble. 
\q1
\v 10 Those who know Yahweh [MTY] trust in him; 
\q2 he never abandons those who come to him ◄ \add for help/to worship him\add*►. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh rules from Zion \add Hill\add*; 
\q2 praise him while you sing to him. 
\q1 Tell \add the people of all\add* the nations the \add marvelous\add* things that he has done. 
\q1
\v 12 He does not forget \add to punish\add* those who have murdered others; 
\q2 and he will not ignore people who are crying because they are suffering. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh, be merciful to me! 
\q1 Look at the ways that my enemies have injured me. 
\q2 Do not allow me to die \add because of these injuries\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 I want to live in order that I can praise you at the gates of Jerusalem [MTY] 
\q2 and to rejoice because you rescued me. 
\q1
\v 15  \add It is as though\add* the \add wicked people of many\add* nations have dug a pit for me to fall into [MET], 
\q2 but they have fallen into that same pit. 
\q1 \add It is as if\add* they spread out a net to catch me [MET], 
\q2 but their feet have been caught in that same net. 
\q1
\v 16 Because of what you have done, people know that you decide matters \add fairly/justly\add*, 
\q2 but \add you allow\add* wicked people to be trapped by the same evil things that they themselves do. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Wicked people will all \add die and\add* be buried in their graves, 
\q2 and \add their spirits\add* will go to be with all those who have ◄forgotten about/rejected► you. 
\q1
\v 18 But you will not forget those who are needy/poor; 
\q2 what they confidently expect will certainly happen. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 Yahweh, arise and judge the \add wicked\add* people of the nations; 
\q2 do not allow them to think that \add because they are strong\add* they will never be punished. 
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh, teach them to be terrified about you. 
\q2 Cause them to know that they are merely human beings. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\c 10  
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, ◄why are you far away \add from us\add*?/it seems that you are far away \add from us\add*. ► [RHQ] 
\q2 Why do you not pay attention when we have troubles [RHQ]? 
\b
\q1
\v 2 People who are proud gladly cause poor people to suffer. 
\q2 So \add cause what they do to others to happen to them\add*! May they be caught in the \add same\add* traps that they set to catch others [MET]! 
\q1
\v 3 They brag about the \add evil\add* things that they want to do. 
\q2 They praise people who seize from others things that do not belong to them, and they curse you, Yahweh. 
\q1
\v 4 Wicked people are very proud. 
\q2 As a result, they do not ◄seek help from/are not concerned about► God; 
\q2 they do not even think that God exists. 
\q1
\v 5 But \add it seems that\add* they succeed in everything that they do. 
\q2 They do not think that they will be condemned/punished for their deeds, 
\q2 and they ◄sneer at/make fun of► their enemies. 
\q1
\v 6 They think, “Nothing bad will happen to us! 
\q2 We will never have troubles!” 
\q1
\v 7 When they talk [MTY], they are always cursing, lying, and threatening to harm others. 
\q2 They constantly say [MTY] evil things that show that they are ready to do cruel things to others. 
\q1
\v 8 They hide in villages, ready to ◄ambush/suddenly attack► and kill people who ◄are innocent/have done nothing wrong►. 
\q2 They constantly search for people who will not be able to ◄resist/defend themselves► \add when they are attacked\add*. 
\q1
\v 9 They are like [MET] lions that crouch down and hide, 
\q2 waiting to pounce on their prey. 
\q2 They are like hunters that catch their prey with a net and then drag it away. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Just like helpless animals are crushed, 
\q2 people who cannot defend themselves are killed because wicked people are very strong. 
\q1
\v 11 Wicked people say, “God will not pay any attention \add to what we do\add*. 
\q2 His eyes are covered, so he never sees anything.” 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh God, arise \add and help us\add* 
\q2 Punish [IDM] those wicked people! 
\q2 And do not forget those who are suffering! 
\q1
\v 13 Wicked people revile you [RHQ] continually. 
\q2 They think, “God will never punish us!” 
\q1
\v 14 But you see the trouble and the distress \add that they cause\add*. 
\q2 People who are suffering expect that you will help them; 
\q2 and you help orphans, \add also\add*. 
\q1
\v 15 ◄Break the arms/Destroy the power► of wicked [DOU] people! 
\q2 Continue to pursue and punish them for the wicked things that they do, until they stop doing those things. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Yahweh, you are our king forever, 
\q2 but \add wicked\add* nations will disappear from the earth. 
\q1
\v 17 You have listened to afflicted/suffering people when they cry out to you. 
\q2 You hear them \add when they pray\add*, and you encourage [IDM] them. 
\q1
\v 18 You show that orphans and oppressed people have not done things that are wrong, 
\q2 with the result that human beings will not cause people to be terrified anymore. 
\c 11  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 I trust that Yahweh will protect [MTY] me. 
\q2 So do not [RHQ] say to me, “You need to escape/flee to the mountains like birds do, 
\q1
\v 2 because wicked people have hidden in the darkness, 
\q1 they have pulled back their bowstrings and aimed their arrows 
\q2 to shoot them at godly/righteous [IDM] people \add like you\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 When people are not punished for disobeying the laws, 
\q2 ◄what can righteous people do?/there is not much that righteous people can do.►” [RHQ] 
\b
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh is sitting on his throne in his sacred temple in heaven, 
\q2 and he [SYN] watches everything that people do. 
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh examines what righteous people do and what wicked people do, 
\q2 and he hates those who like to perform violent actions \add to injure others\add*. 
\q1
\v 6 He will send down \add from the sky\add* flaming coals and burning sulfur, 
\q2 and send scorching hot winds to punish wicked people. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh is righteous and he loves those who act righteously; 
\q2 righteous people are able to come into his presence. 
\c 12  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, help us! 
\q2 \add It seems that\add* people who are loyal to you have all vanished. 
\q1
\v 2 Everyone tells lies to other people; 
\q2 they deceive others by ◄flattering them/saying good things about them that they know are not true►. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, we wish that you would cut off their tongues 
\q2 so that they cannot continue to boast. 
\q1
\v 4 They say, “By telling lies we will get what we want; 
\q2 we control what we say [MTY], so no one can tell us what we should not do!” 
\b
\q1
\v 5 But Yahweh replies, “I have seen the violent things that they have done to helpless people; 
\q2 and I have heard those people groaning, 
\q2 so I will arise and rescue the people who are wanting me to help them.” 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh, you always do what you have promised to do; 
\q2 what you have promised is \add as precious and pure as\add* silver 
\q2 that has been heated seven times in a furnace \add to get rid of all the\add* impure material. 
\b
\q1
\v 7-8 Wicked people strut around \add proudly\add*, 
\q2 and people praise them for doing vile/wicked deeds, 
\q1 but Yahweh, \add we know that\add* you will protect/rescue us 
\q2 from those wicked people. 
\c 13  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, how long will you continue to forget about me [RHQ]? 
\q2 Will you hide yourself [SYN] from me forever? 
\q1
\v 2 How long must I endure anguish/worry? 
\q2 Must I be miserable/sad every day? 
\q2 How long will my enemies continue to defeat me? 
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh my God, look at me and answer me. 
\q2 Enable me to become strong \add again\add* [IDM], and do not allow me to die.

\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1  \add Only\add* foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!” 
\q1 People who say those things are corrupt/worthless; they do abominable/detestable deeds; 
\q2 there is not one \add of them\add* who does what is good/right. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees humans; 
\q1 he looks to see if anyone is very wise, 
\q2 with the result that he desires \add to know\add* God. 
\q1
\v 3 But they are all corrupt/evil; 
\q2 no one does what is good/right. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Will those evil people never learn \add what God will do to punish them\add* [RHQ]? 
\q1 They act violently toward Yahweh's people while eating the food that he provides, 
\q2 and they never pray to Yahweh. 
\q1
\v 5 But \add some day\add* they will become very terrified 
\q2 because God helps those who act righteously \add and will punish those who reject him\add*.

\b
\q1
\v 2 Only those who always do what is right and do not sin may do that. 
\q2 They always say what is true 
\q2

\s1 A psalm written by David 
\q1
\v 1 God, protect me 
\q2 because I go to you to keep me safe! 
\b
\q1
\v 2 I said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord; 
\q2 all the good things that I have come from you.” 
\q1
\v 3 Your people who live in this land are wonderful; 
\q2 I delight to be with them.

\q2 so nothing will ◄perturb me/cause me to be worried►. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 Therefore I am glad and I [MTY, DOU] rejoice; 
\q2 I can rest securely 
\q1
\v 10 because you, Yahweh, will not allow my soul/spirit to remain in the place where the dead people are; 
\q2 you will not allow me, your godly one, to stay there. 
\q1
\v 11 You will show me the road that leads to \add receiving eternal\add* life,

\q2 because I am speaking [MTY] honestly/truthfully. 
\q1
\v 2 You are the one who is able to declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done anything that was wrong► 
\q2 because you see/know that I am telling the truth. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 You know what I think, \add even\add* at night; 
\q2 you have examined what I say and do, 
\q1 and you know that I have determined to never tell any lies.

\v 4 I have not done like others do; 
\q2 I have always done what is right [IDM], 
\q1 and I have not acted cruelly toward others.

\v 8 Protect me as people carefully protect their own eyes; 
\q2 protect me like \add birds\add* protect \add their babies\add* under their wings [MET]. 
\q1
\v 9 Do not allow wicked people to attack me; 
\q2 my enemies surround me, wanting to kill me. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 They never pity [IDM] anyone, 
\q2 and they are always boasting. 
\q1
\v 11 They have hunted/searched for me and found me. 
\q2 They surround me, watching for an opportunity to throw me to the ground. 
\q1
\v 12 They are like lions [SIM] that are ready to tear apart the animals that they capture; 
\q2 they are like young lions that are hiding, waiting to pounce \add on their prey\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh, come and ◄oppose/fight against► my enemies and defeat them! 
\q2 Use your sword to save me from those wicked people! 
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh, by your power [MTY] rescue me from those people who are interested \add only\add* in things here in this world. 
\b
\q1 But you provide plenty of food for those whom you love dearly; 
\q2 their children also have many things that their grandchildren will inherit. 
\q1
\v 15 Yahweh, because I act righteously, I will \add some day\add* see you [SYN]. 
\q2 When I awake, I will see you face-to-face, and then I will be happy.

\s1 A psalm written by God's servant David. He sang it after Yahweh had rescued him from Saul and his other enemies. 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I love you, the one who enables me to be strong. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh is like an \add overhanging\add* rock [DOU, MET] \add under which I can hide from my enemies\add*; 
\q2 he is like a strong fortress, the one who protects me; 
\q1 he protects me like a shield [MET] \add protects a soldier\add*; 
\q2 he is the one to whom I go ◄for refuge/to be protected/safe►, 
\q2 and he defends me by his great power [IDM]. 
\q1
\v 3 I called out to Yahweh, who deserves to be praised, 
\q2 and he rescued me from my enemies. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 All around me were dangerous situations in which I might be killed [PRS]; 
\q2 it was as though there were huge waves [MET] that almost crashed on me and killed me. 
\q1
\v 5  \add It was as though\add* the place where dead people are had ropes that were wrapped around me, 
\q2 or \add it was as though\add* there was a trap [MET] that would \add seize and\add* kill me. 
\q1
\v 6 But when I was very distressed, I called out to Yahweh, 
\q1 and from his temple he heard me. 
\q2 He listened to me when I cried out \add for help\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth quaked/shook strongly [DOU]; 
\q2 the mountains shook very strongly from their centers [DOU] 
\q2 because Yahweh was angry. 
\q1
\v 8  \add It was as though\add* smoke poured out from his nostrils, 
\q2 and \add as though\add* burning coals came out of his mouth. 
\q1
\v 9 He opened the sky and came down 
\q2 with a black cloud under his feet. 
\q1
\v 10 He flew, riding on the back of a creature that had wings, 
\q2 traveling \add fast\add*, blown along by the wind. 
\q1
\v 11 Darkness was all around him \add like a blanket\add* [MET]; 
\q2 dark clouds, full of moisture, covered him [MET]. 
\q1
\v 12 Hailstones and flashes of lightning were around him; 
\q2 hail and burning coals fell from the sky. 
\q1
\v 13 Then Yahweh \add spoke in a loud voice\add* from the sky, 
\q2 and \add his enemies\add* heard his voice that sounded like thunder. 
\q1
\v 14 He shot his arrows at them and caused them to scatter; 
\q2 His flashes of lightning caused them to become very confused (OR, to run away). 
\q1
\v 15 The bottom of the ocean became visible, 
\q2 and the foundations of the earth were uncovered, 
\q2 when Yahweh rebuked his enemies 
\q2 when he snorted. 
\b
\q1
\v 16  \add It was as though\add* he reached down from heaven and grabbed me 
\q2 and pulled me up out of the deep ocean. 
\q1
\v 17 He rescued me from my strong enemies who hated me; 
\q2 they were very strong, 
\q2 with the result that I \add could not defeat them\add*. 
\q1
\v 18 When I ◄was distressed/had troubles►, they attacked me, 
\q2 but Yahweh defended/protected me. 
\q1
\v 19 He led me to a place where I was safe; 
\q2 he rescued me because he was pleased with me. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because I do what is right; 
\q2 he has blessed me because I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►. 
\q1
\v 21 I have obeyed Yahweh's laws; 
\q2 I have not abandoned him. 
\q1
\v 22 My behavior was directed by his rules; 
\q2 I have not stopped obeying them. 
\q1
\v 23 He knows that I have not done what is wrong; 
\q2 I have kept myself from sinning. 
\q1
\v 24 So he rewards me because I do what is right; 
\q2 he knows that I [SYN] have not committed sins. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 Yahweh, you are faithful to those who faithfully \add do what you tell them to do\add*; 
\q2 you always do what is good/right to those who do what you want them to do. 
\q1
\v 26 You are kind to those who are kind to others, 
\q2 but you act wisely toward those who ◄act perversely/do bad things►. 
\q1
\v 27 You save those who are humble, 
\q2 but you cause those who are proud to be humiliated/ashamed. 
\q1
\v 28 You give light to my \add soul/spirit\add*; 
\q2 you take away the darkness of my soul. 
\q1
\v 29 You enable me to be strong, 
\q2 with the result that I can run and attack a line of enemy soldiers; 
\q2 with your help I can ◄scale/climb up► the walls \add that surround my enemies' cities\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Everything that Yahweh my God does is perfect. 
\q2 We can depend on him to do what he promises. 
\q1 He is like a shield [MET] to protect all those who go to him for refuge. 
\q1
\v 31 Yahweh is [RHQ] the only one who is God; 
\q2 only he is like an \add overhanging\add* rock \add under which we can be safe\add*. 
\q1
\v 32 God is the one who enables me to be strong 
\q2 and who keeps me safe on the roads that I walk on. 
\q1
\v 33 He enables me to \add walk swiftly without stumbling\add*, 
\q2 like a deer walks/runs in the mountains. 
\q1
\v 34 He teaches me how to use a strong/metal bow 
\q2 in order that I can use it to fight in battles. 
\b
\q1
\v 35 Yahweh, you protect and save me with your shield; 
\q2 you have made me safe by your power [MTY]. 
\q2 I have become ◄strong/a great \add king\add*► because you have helped me. 
\q1
\v 36 You havecleared the road for me, 
\q2 with the result that now I do not slip/stumble. 
\b
\q1
\v 37 I have pursued my enemies and caught them; 
\q2 I did not stop until I had defeated/killed them all. 
\q1
\v 38 When I strike them, they are not able to get up again; 
\q2 they lie on the ground, defeated. 
\q1
\v 39 You have enabled me to be strong 
\q2 in order that I can fight battles and defeat my enemies. 
\q1
\v 40 You caused my enemies to run away (OR, you enabled me to put my foot on my enemies' necks \add after I captured them and forced them to lie on the ground\add*); 
\q2 I have gotten rid of all those who hated me. 
\q1
\v 41 They called out for someone to help them, 
\q2 but no one saved them. 
\q1
\v 42 I pulverize them, 
\q2 with the result that they become like [MET] the dust that the wind \add blows away\add*; 
\q2 I throw them out like [SIM] \add people throw\add* dirt out into the streets. 
\b
\q1
\v 43 You enabled me to defeat those who fought against me, 
\q2 and appointed me to be the ruler of \add many \add*nations; 
\q1 people whom I did not know about previously are now slaves \add in my kingdom\add*. 
\q1
\v 44 When foreigners hear about me, 
\q2 they ◄cringe/bow low before me► and they obey me. 
\q1
\v 45 They are no longer courageous, 
\q2 and from their forts \add where they were hiding\add* they come \add to me\add* trembling. 
\b
\q1
\v 46 Yahweh is alive! 
\q2 Praise the one who is like an \add overhanging\add* rock [MET] \add under which I am safe\add* 
\q2 Exalt the God who saves me! 
\q1
\v 47 He enables me to get revenge on my enemies;

\q1
\v 48 and he rescues me from my enemies. 
\q1 He has lifted me up high so that violent men could not reach me \add and harm me\add*. 
\q1
\v 49 So I praise him \add and I tell\add* the nations \add the great things that he has done\add*.

\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director

\v 2 Day after day \add it is as though the sun\add* proclaims \add the glory of God\add*, 
\q2 and night after night \add it is as though the moon and stars\add* say that they know \add that God made them\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 They do not really speak;

\q2 There is no voice \add from them\add* for anyone to hear.

\q1 The sun is in the skies where God placed it [MET];

\q1
\v 9 It is good for people to revere Yahweh; 
\q2 that is something that they will do forever. 
\q1 What Yahweh has decided is fair, 
\q2 and it is always right. 
\q1
\v 10 The things that God has decided are more valuable than gold, 
\q2 even the finest/purest gold. 
\q1 They are sweeter than honey 
\q2 that drips from honeycombs. 
\q1
\v 11 Furthermore, \add by reading them\add* I learn \add what things are good to do and what things are evil\add*, 
\q1 and they promise a great reward 
\q2 to \add us who\add* obey them. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 But there is no one who can know all his errors [RHQ]; 
\q2 so Yahweh, forgive me for these things which I do that I do not realize are wrong. 
\q1
\v 13 Keep me from doing things that I know are wrong; 
\q2 do not let my sinful desires control me. 
\q1 If you do that, I will no longer be guilty for committing such sins,

\v 3 When I did not confess my sins,

\v 4 Day and night, \add Yahweh\add*, you [SYN] punished me severely. 
\q2 My strength drained away like \add water that\add* ◄ \add evaporates/dries up\add*► on a hot summer \add day\add*. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 5  \add Then/Finally\add* I admitted/confessed my sins to you; 
\q2 I stopped trying to hide them. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1 I said \add to myself\add*, 
\q2 “I will confess to Yahweh the wrong things that I have done.” 
\q1 And \add when I confessed them\add*, you forgave me, 
\q2 so now I ◄am no longer guilty/will no longer be punished► for my sins.

\v 13 Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees all us people;

\v 14 from where he rules [MTY], he looks down on all the people who live on the earth. 
\q1
\v 15 He formed our inner beings, 
\q2 and he sees everything that we do. 
\q1
\v 16 It is not because a king has a great army that he is able to win \add battles\add*,

\b
\q1
\v 4 Cause those who are trying to kill me to be defeated and disgraced! 
\q1 Cause those who are planning to do evil things to me to be pushed back and become confused! 
\q1
\v 5 Send your angel to pursue them, 
\q2 and as a result cause them to disappear like chaff/straw blown away by the wind! 
\q1
\v 6 Cause the path on which they run to be dark and slippery 
\q2 as your angel pursues them! 
\q1
\v 7 Although I did not do anything wrong to them, 
\q2 they concealed a deep pit for me to fall into; 
\q2 they hid a net in which they would catch me. 
\q1
\v 8 Cause them to suddenly experience disaster! 
\q2 Cause them to be trapped in their own nets! 
\q1 Cause them to fall into the pits that they have dug for me and disappear! 
\q1
\v 9 Then I will be joyful about what you, Yahweh, have done for me,

\v 12 In return for my doing good things for them, they do evil things to me,

\q1
\v 13 When they were ill, I showed that I was sad. 
\q2 I did not eat any food, and I bowed my head as I prayed \add for them\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 I mourned and bowed my head as I prayed

\q1
\v 1  \add Wicked people continually desire to\add* sin.

\q1
\v 16 It is good to be righteous/godly even if you do not have many possessions,

\v 17 I say that because I am about to fall down, 
\q2 and I constantly have pain. 
\q1
\v 18 I confess the wrong things that I have done; 
\q2 I am \add very\add* sorry for the sins that I have committed. 
\q1
\v 19 My enemies are healthy and strong; 
\q2 there are many people who hate me for no reason. 
\q1
\v 20 Those who do evil things to me in return for my doing good things to them 
\q2 oppose me because I try to do what is right. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Yahweh, do not abandon me! 
\q2 My God, do not stay far from me! 
\q1
\v 22 Lord, you are the one who saves/rescues me; 
\q2 Quickly \add come and\add* help me! 
\c 39  
\s1 A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 I said \add to myself\add*, “I will be careful not to sin by the things that I say [MTY]. 
\q1 I will not say anything \add to complain\add* 
\q2 while wicked people are near to me \add and can hear me\add*.” 
\q1
\v 2  \add So\add* I was completely silent [DOU], and I did not \add even\add* talk about things that were good, 
\q2 but it was useless, because I began to suffer even more. 
\q1
\v 3 I became very anxious/worried [IDM]. 
\q2 As I thought \add about my troubles\add*, I became more worried. 
\q1 Then \add finally\add* I said [MTY], 
\b
\q1
\v 4 “Yahweh, show/tell me how long I will live. 
\q2 Tell me when I will die. 
\q2 Tell me how many years I will live! 
\q1
\v 5  \add It seems that\add* you have caused me to live only a short time; 
\q2 ◄my lifetime/all the time that I have lived► seems like nothing to you. 
\q2 The time that all we humans live is \add as short as\add* [MET] a puff of wind. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 6 Then we disappear like a shadow does. 
\q2 It seems that all that we do is for nothing/useless. 
\q2 We \add sometimes\add* get a lot of money, but we do not know who will get it \add after we die\add*. 
\q1
\v 7 So now, Yahweh, if I expect [RHQ] \add to receive blessings from other people\add*, I will be disappointed. 
\q2 You are the \add only\add* one from whom I confidently expect \add to receive blessings\add*. 
\q1
\v 8 Save me from \add being punished for\add* all the sins that I have committed. 
\q2 And do not allow foolish people to make fun of me. 
\q1
\v 9 I did not say anything \add when you punished me\add*, 
\q2 because \add I knew that\add* you were the one who caused \add me to suffer\add*. 
\q1
\v 10 But now, please stop punishing me! 
\q2 \add If you do not do that\add*, I am about to die because of the ways that you [SYN] have struck/afflicted me. 
\q1
\v 11 When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed, 
\q2 you destroy the things that ◄he loves/are precious to him►, like moths' \add larva\add* destroy clothing. 
\q2 Our lives \add disappear like\add* a puff of wind. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray; 
\q2 pay attention to me while I cry out to you. 
\q2 Help me while I am crying. 
\q1 I am here on the earth for only a short time, 
\q2 like all my ancestors. 
\q1
\v 13  \add Now\add* please leave me alone, \add and do not punish me anymore\add* 
\q2 in order that I may smile and be happy for a while before I die. [EUP, DOU]” 
\c 40  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 I waited patiently for Yahweh \add to help me\add*, 
\q2 and he listened to me [DOU] when I called out to him. 
\q1
\v 2  \add When I had many troubles, it was as though\add* I was in a deep pit. 
\q2 But he lifted me up out of the mud and slime of that pit; 
\q1 he set my feet on a \add solid\add* rock, 
\q2 and enabled me to walk ◄safely/without falling►. 
\q1
\v 3 He has given me a new song to sing, 
\q2 a song to praise him who is our God. 
\q1 Many people will find out \add what he has done for me\add*, 
\q2 and they will revere and trust him. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh is pleased with those who trust him, 
\q2 those who do not trust in idols 
\q2 or join with those who worship those false gods. 
\q1
\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things! 
\q2 No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us. 
\q1 If I tried to tell \add others\add* about all those wonderful things, 
\q1 I would not be able to, 
\q2 because there would be too many for me to mention. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Various kinds of sacrifices and other offerings are not the \add only\add* things that delight you. 
\q2 You have enabled me to understand that very well [IDM]. 
\q1 \add Animals\add* burned \add on the altar\add* and \add other\add* offerings 
\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*. 
\q1
\v 7 So I said \add to you\add*, “Yahweh, here I am, 
\q2 \add to do\add* the things that have been written in the scroll \add that contains your laws\add*, 
\q2 things that you want me \add to do\add*.” 
\q1
\v 8 O my God, I delight to do what you desire; 
\q2 I \add keep\add* your laws within my inner being. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 Whenever all \add your people\add* are gathered, 
\q2 I have told them about how you save us. 
\q2 Yahweh, you know that I have not been afraid to tell that to them. 
\q1
\v 10 And I have not kept to myself the news that you always act justly/fairly; 
\q2 when many of your people have gathered together \add to worship you in the temple\add*, 
\q1 I have told them that you are faithful to us and save us. 
\q2 I have ◄not concealed/openly told people► that you faithfully love us and act loyally toward us. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, do not stop being merciful to me. 
\q2 Because you faithfully love \add me\add* [PRS] and are loyal \add to me\add*, always protect me. 
\q1
\v 12 I have many troubles; \add so many that\add* I cannot count them. 
\q2 My sins are like a flood that has covered me [PRS, MET]; 
\q2 \add they are so many that\add* I cannot find my way. 
\q1 The sins that I have committed are more than the hairs on my head. 
\q2 I am very discouraged. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 O Yahweh, please save me! 
\q2 Come quickly to help me! 
\q1
\v 14 Humble those who are happy about my troubles, and cause them to be disgraced and ashamed. 
\q2 Chase away those who are trying to get rid of me. 
\q1
\v 15 I hope/desire that those who make fun of me 
\q2 will be dismayed when you defeat them. 
\q1
\v 16 But I hope that all those who go to \add worship\add* you will be very joyful [DOU]. 
\q2 I want those who love you because you saved them to shout repeatedly, 
\q1 “Yahweh is great!” 
\b
\q1
\v 17 As for me, I am poor and needy [DOU]; 
\q2 but \add I know that\add* Yahweh has not forgotten me. 
\q1 O my God, you are the one who saves and helps me, 
\q2 so please come quickly \add and help me!\add* 
\c 41  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh is pleased with those people who help to provide for the poor; 
\q2 he will rescue those people when they have troubles. 
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh protects them and allows them to live \add for a long time\add*. 
\q2 He enables them to be happy in the land \add of Israel\add*, 
\q2 and rescues them from their enemies. 
\q1
\v 3 When they are sick, Yahweh strengthens them, 
\q2 and he heals them. 
\b
\q1
\v 4  \add When I was sick\add*, I said, “Yahweh, be merciful to me and heal me; 
\q2 \add I know that I am sick because\add* I have sinned against you.” 
\q1
\v 5 My enemies say cruel things about me; 
\q2 they say, “How soon will he die, and then everyone will forget about him [MTY]? (OR, he will not have \add any descendants to continue\add* his name).” 
\q1
\v 6 When my enemies come to me, they falsely say that they \add are concerned about me\add*. 
\q2 They listen to bad news about ◄me/my health►. 
\q2 Then they go away and tell everywhere what is happening to me. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 All those who hate me whisper to others about me, 
\q2 and they hope/desire that very bad things will happen to me. 
\q1
\v 8 They say, “He will soon die because of his being sick; 
\q2 he will never get up from his bed \add before he dies\add*.” 
\q1
\v 9 Even my best friend, whom I trusted very much, 
\q2 who \add often\add* ate with me, 
\q2 has ◄betrayed me/put me into my enemies' hands► [IDM]. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 But Yahweh, be merciful to me, and enable me to become healthy \add again\add*. 
\q2 When you do that, I will be able to ◄pay back my enemies/get revenge on my enemies/cause my enemies to suffer like they caused me to suffer►. 
\q1
\v 11  \add If you enable me to\add* do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me, 
\q2 I will know that you are pleased with me. 
\q1
\v 12  \add I will know that\add* it is because I have done what is right that you have helped me, 
\q2 and \add I will know that\add* you will let me be with you forever.

\ms1 Book Two 
\s1 A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 Deer pant, desiring to drink water from a stream \add when there is a drought\add* (OR, \add when they are being pursued by hunters\add*.) 
\q2 In the same way [SIM], God, I need you very much. 
\q1
\v 2 I desire to have fellowship with [MET] you, the all-powerful God. 
\q2 \add I wonder\add*, “When will I be able to go \add back to the temple in Israel\add* 
\q2 and worship in your presence again?” 
\q1
\v 3 Every day and every night I cry; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* the only thing I have to drink is my tears; 
\q1 and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me, 
\q2 “Why does your god not \add help you\add*?” 
\q1
\v 4 I am very distressed [IDM] as I remember 
\q2 when I went with the crowd of people to the temple \add in Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 leading them as we walked along; 
\q1 we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God \add for what he had done\add*; 
\q2 we were a large group who were celebrating. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 So \add I say to\add* myself, “◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ] 
\q1 I confidently expect God \add to help me\add*, 
\q2 and again I will praise him, 
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.” 
\b
\q1
\v 6  \add But now, Yahweh\add*, I am very discouraged [IDM], 
\q2 so I think about you, 
\q1 even from where the Jordan \add River\add* gushes out from the bottom of \add Mount\add* Hermon and from Mount Mizar. 
\q1
\v 7 But here, the great sorrow that I feel is like water that you send down [MET]; 
\q2 \add it is like\add* a waterfall that tumbles down and floods over me. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh shows me each day that he faithfully loves me, 
\q2 and each night I sing to him 
\q2 and pray to him, the God who causes me to live. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 I say to God, \add who is like\add* an \add overhanging\add* rock \add under which I can hide\add* [MET], 
\q1 “It seems that you have forgotten me. 
\q2 I ‘mourn/cry’ constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me” [RHQ]. 
\q1
\v 10 They make fun of me constantly; 
\q2 they continually ask, “Why does your god not help you?” [RHQ] 
\q1 And when they insult me \add like that\add*, 
\q2 \add it is like\add* wounds that I feel even in my bones. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 But \add I think,\add* 
\q2 “◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ] 
\q1 I will confidently expect God \add to help me\add*, 
\q2 and I will praise him again, 
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.” 
\c 43  
\s1 (A continuation of psalm 42) 
\q1
\v 1 God, declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►. 
\q1 Defend me when ◄ungodly people/people who do not worship you► say things against me, 
\q2 rescue me from people who deceive and \add say things about me that are\add* not true. 
\q1
\v 2 You are God, the one who protects me; 
\q2 ◄why have you abandoned me?/it seems that you have abandoned me!► [RHQ] 
\q1 It does not seem right that [RHQ] I am forced to mourn/cry constantly 
\q2 because my enemies are cruel to me. 
\q1
\v 3 Shine your light on me and speak your truth to me; 
\q1 and let them guide me, 
\q2 and take me back to Zion, your sacred hill \add at Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 and to \add your temple\add*, where you live. 
\q1
\v 4 When you do that, I will go to your altar, 
\q2 to \add worship you\add*, my God, who causes me to be extremely joyful. 
\q2 There I will praise you, the God whom I \add worship\add*, while I play my harp. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 So ◄why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ] 
\q1 I confidently expect God \add to bless me\add*, 
\q2 and I will praise him again, 
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.

\s1 A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 God, we ourselves have heard 
\q2 what our parents and grandparents told us. 
\q1 They told us about the miracles 
\q2 that you performed long ago. 
\q1
\v 2  \add They told us\add* how you expelled the ungodly people 
\q2 and enabled us to live in their land. 
\q1 \add They told us\add* that you punished those ungodly people 
\q2 and enabled your own people to prosper [IDM]. 
\q1
\v 3 It was not by using their own swords that they conquered the people that lived in that land, 
\q2 and it was not by their own power that they were victorious; 
\q1 it was only by your power [MTY, DOU] \add that they did those things\add*; 
\q2 and they were sure that you were with them, 
\q2 and that showed that you were pleased with them. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 You are my King and my God; 
\q2 it is you who enable us, your people [MTY], to defeat our enemies. 
\q1
\v 5 It is by your power that we knock our enemies down and tramp on them. 
\q1
\v 6 I do not trust that I will be saved 
\q2 by using my bow \add and arrows\add* and my sword. 
\q1
\v 7 No, it is you who have rescued us from our enemies, 
\q2 it is you who have caused those who hate us to become ashamed \add because they were defeated\add*. 
\q1
\v 8 We have continually boasted about what God \add has done for us\add*, 
\q2 and we will thank him [MTY] forever. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 9 But \add now\add* you have rejected us and caused us to be disgraced; 
\q2 when our armies march out \add to fight a battle\add*, you no \add longer\add* go with them. 
\q1
\v 10 You have caused us to run away from our enemies, 
\q2 with the result that they captured the things that belonged to us. 
\q1
\v 11 You have allowed us to become like [MET] sheep that were ready to be slaughtered; 
\q2 you scattered us \add far away\add* among \add other \add*nations. 
\q1
\v 12  \add It is as though\add* [MET] you sold us, your people, \add to our enemies\add* for a very small price, 
\q2 and you did not gain much profit from selling us! 
\b
\q1
\v 13 People who live in nations near us make fun of us; 
\q2 they laugh at us and deride/belittle us. 
\q1
\v 14 They make jokes using the name of \add our country\add*, 
\q2 they shake their heads \add to indicate that they despise us\add*. 
\q1
\v 15 All day I feel disgraced; 
\q2 from seeing my face, people know that I am ashamed. 
\q1
\v 16 I hear what those who sneer at me and revile me say; 
\q2 I am ashamed in front of my enemies and those who want to harm me. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 All these things have happened to us 
\q2 \add even\add* though we have not forgotten you, 
\q2 and we are not the ones who disobeyed the agreement you made with \add our ancestors\add*. 
\q1
\v 18 We have not stopped being loyal to you, 
\q2 and we have not stopped doing what you want us to do [IDM]. 
\q1
\v 19 But \add it is as though\add* you have allowed us to be helpless among wild animals, 
\q2 and abandoned us in a deep dark \add ravine\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 If we had forgotten to worship [MTY] our God, 
\q2 or if we had spread out our hands to \add worship\add* a foreign god, 
\q1
\v 21 you certainly would have known that, 
\q2 because you know \add even\add* what we secretly think. 
\q1
\v 22 But it is because we belong to you, 
\q2 \add that our enemies\add* are constantly killing us. 
\q1 They act toward us as though we were only sheep to be slaughtered. 
\b
\q1
\v 23  \add So\add*, Yahweh, arise! Why are you asleep [RHQ]? 
\q2 Get up! Do not reject us forever! 
\q1
\v 24 Why are you not looking at us? 
\q2 Why are you forgetting that we are suffering and being oppressed \add by our enemies\add*? 
\b
\q1
\v 25 We are pushed down to the ground 
\q2 and we cannot get up. 
\q1
\v 26 Arise, and come and help us! 
\q2 Rescue us because you faithfully love us!

\v 5 Your arrows are sharp, 
\q2 and they pierce the hearts of your enemies. 
\q2 Soldiers of many nations will fall dead at your feet. 
\q1
\v 6 The kingdom [MTY] that God will give to you will remain forever. 
\q2 You rule [MTY] people justly. 
\q1
\v 7 You love right actions, 
\q2 and you hate evil actions. 
\q1 Therefore God, your God, has chosen [MTY] you \add to be king\add* 
\q2 and caused you to be happier [MET] than any other king. 
\q1
\v 8 The perfume of various spices is on your robes. 
\q2 \add People\add* ◄entertain you/make you happy► in ivory palaces 
\q2 by playing stringed instruments. 
\q1
\v 9 Among the women who stay near you [EUP] stay are daughters of \add other\add* kings. 
\q2 And at your right hand stands \add your bride\add*, the queen, wearing beautiful ornaments of gold that comes from Ophir.

\q1 Listen to me carefully [DOU]! 
\q2 Forget the people who live in your home country, 
\q2 forget your relatives! 
\q1
\v 11 Because you are \add very \add*beautiful, 
\q2 the king will desire \add to sleep with\add* [EUP] you. 
\q2 He is your master, so you must obey him. 
\q1
\v 12 The people from Tyre \add city\add* will bring gifts to you; 
\q2 their rich people will try to persuade you to do favors for them. 
\b
\q1
\v 13  \add O king\add*, your bride will be entering the palace 
\q2 wearing beautiful robes made from gold thread. 
\q1
\v 14 While she is wearing a gown that has many colors, 
\q2 her companions will lead her to you. 
\q2 She will have many other young women who accompany her. 
\q1
\v 15 They will be very joyful [DOU] as they are led along 
\q2 to enter your palace. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Some day, your sons and your grandsons will become kings, 
\q2 just like your ancestors were. 
\q1 You will enable them to become rulers in many countries [HYP]. 
\q1
\v 17 And as for me, I will enable people in every generation to remember the great things that you [MTY] have done, 
\q2 and people will praise you forever.

\v 1 Yahweh is great, and he deserves to be greatly praised in the city where he \add lives\add*, 
\q2 \add which is built on Zion\add*, his sacred hill. 
\q1
\v 2 That city, on a high \add hill\add*, is beautiful; 
\q2 it is the city where the true \add God\add*, the great king, \add lives\add*, 
\q2 and it causes people all over the world to rejoice \add when they see it\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 God is in the strong towers there, 
\q2 and he shows that he protects the people in that city. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Many kings gathered \add with their armies\add* to attack \add that city\add*, 
\q1
\v 5 but when they saw it, they were amazed; 
\q2 they became terrified, and ran away. 
\q1
\v 6 Because they were very afraid, they trembled 
\q2 like a woman who is about to give birth to a child; 
\q1
\v 7 they shook \add like\add* ships sailing from Tarshish are shaken by a strong wind. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 We had heard \add that this city is glorious\add*, 
\q1 and now we have seen that it is. 
\q2 It is the city in which Yahweh, the almighty one, \add lives\add*. 
\q2 It is the city which God will preserve/protect forever. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, \add here\add* in your temple we think about how you faithfully love us. 
\q1
\v 10 You [MTY] are famous and ◄are praised/people praise you► all over the earth, 
\q2 because you rule powerfully [MTY] and justly. 
\q1
\v 11 The people who live near Zion Hill should be happy! 
\q1 The people in \add all\add* the cities [MTY] of Judah should rejoice 
\q2 because you judge people fairly. 
\b
\q1
\v 12  \add You Israeli people should\add* walk around Zion \add Hill\add* 
\q2 and count the towers there; 
\q1
\v 13 notice the walls there and examine the forts 
\q2 in order that you can tell about them to your children. 
\q1
\v 14  \add Say to them\add*, “This is \add the city that belngs to\add* our God, \add the one who lives\add* forever; 
\q2 he will guide us all of our lives.”

\s1 A psalm written for the choir director by one of the descendants of Korah 
\q1
\v 1 You people of all ethnic groups, listen! 
\q1 You people all over the world, 
\q2
\v 2 important people and unimportant people, 
\q2 rich people and poor people, 
\q1 everyone, \add listen to what I am saying\add*, 
\q1
\v 3  \add because\add* what I am thinking is very sensible, 
\q2 and what I say will enable you to become wise! 
\q1
\v 4 I think about [MTY] ◄proverbs/wise sayings►, 
\q2 and while I play my harp, I explain what they mean. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 I am not [RHQ] afraid when I am in trouble/danger, 
\q2 when I am surrounded by my enemies, 
\q1
\v 6 by evil men who trust that \add things will always go well for them because\add* they are wealthy, 
\q2 and who boast about being very rich. 
\q1
\v 7  \add They may be rich\add*, but no one can pay money 
\q2 with the result that he would live forever! 
\q1 No one can pay God enough so that God will allow him \add to continue\add* to live, 
\q1
\v 8 because that cost is too grreat, 
\q2 and he will never be able to pay enough 
\q1
\v 9 with the result that he will live forever 
\q2 and never \add die and\add* be buried! 
\b
\q1
\v 10 We see that foolish and stupid people die, 
\q1 but we see that wise people also die; 
\q2 they all leave their wealth, and others inherit it. 
\q1
\v 11 Those wise people once had \add houses on\add* land that they owned, 
\q1 \add but now\add* their graves are their homes forever, 
\q2 the place where they will stay for all time! 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Even if people are great, that cannot prevent them from dying; 
\q2 all people die, the same as animals do. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 That is what happens to those who foolishly trust \add in what they have accomplished\add*, 
\q2 to those who are delighted in \add all\add* that they possess. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 14 They are certain to die just like sheep, 
\q2 when a shepherd leads them away to be slaughtered. [PRS, MET] 
\q1 In the morning righteous people will rule over them, 
\q1 and then \add those wealthy people will die and\add* their bodies will quickly decay in their graves; 
\q2 they will be where dead people are, far from their homes. 
\q1
\v 15 But it is certain that God will rescue me 
\q2 so that I am not kept in the place of the dead. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 16  \add So\add*, do not be dismayed when someone becomes rich 
\q2 and the houses where they live become more and more luxurious, 
\q1
\v 17 because when he dies, he will take nothing with him; 
\q2 his wealth will not go with him. 
\q1
\v 18 While \add a rich person\add* is alive, he congratulates himself, 
\q2 and people praise him for being successful, 
\q1
\v 19 but he will \add die\add*, joining his ancestors, 
\q2 who will never see daylight again. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Even if someone is great, that cannot prevent him from dying; 
\q2 he will die, the same as animals do.

\s1 A psalm written by Asaph 
\q1
\v 1 God, the all-powerful one, speaks; 
\q1 he summons all people, 
\q2 from the east to the west. 
\q1
\v 2 His glory shines from Zion \add Hill in Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 an extremely beautiful city. 
\q1
\v 3 Our God comes to us, 
\q2 and he is not silent. 
\q1 A great fire is in front of him, 
\q2 and a storm is around him. 
\q1
\v 4 He comes to judge his people. 
\q1 He shouts to the \add angels in\add* heaven 
\q2 and to \add the people on\add* the earth. 
\q1
\v 5 He says, “Summon those who faithfully \add worship\add* me, 
\q2 those who made an agreement with me by offering sacrifices to me.” 
\q1
\v 6 The \add angels in\add* heaven declare, 
\q2 “God is righteous, 
\q2 and he is the supreme judge.” 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 7 God says, “My people, listen! 
\q2 You Israeli people, listen, 
\q1 as I, your God, say what you have done that is wrong. 
\q1
\v 8 I am not rebuking you for making sacrifices to me, 
\q2 for the offerings that you completely burn \add on the altar\add*. 
\q1
\v 9 But I do not really need \add you to sacrifice \add* 
\q2 the bulls from your barns and the goats from your pens, 
\q1
\v 10 because all the animals in the forest belong to me, 
\q2 \add and all\add* the cattle on a thousand hills also belong to me. 
\q1
\v 11 I \add own and\add* know all the birds 
\q2 and all \add the creatures \add* that move around in the fields. 
\q1
\v 12  \add So\add*, if I were hungry, I would not tell you \add to bring me some food\add*, 
\q2 because everything in the world belongs to me! 
\q1
\v 13 I do not eat the flesh of the bulls \add that you sacrifice\add*, 
\q2 and I do not drink the blood of the goats \add that you offer to me\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 The sacrifice \add that I really want is that\add* you thank me 
\q2 and do all that you have promised to do. 
\q1
\v 15 And pray to me when you have troubles. 
\q2 \add If you do that\add*, I will rescue you, and \add then\add* you will praise me. 
\q1
\v 16 But I say this to the wicked people: 
\q1 ◄Why do you/It does not benefit you at all to► [RHQ] recite my commandments 
\q2 or talk about the agreement that I made with you, 
\q1
\v 17 because you have refused to allow me to discipline you, 
\q2 and you have rejected what I told you to do. 
\q1
\v 18 Every time that you see a thief, you become his friend, 
\q2 and you spend \add much\add* time with those who commit adultery. 
\q1
\v 19 You are \add always\add* talking [MTY] about doing wicked things, 
\q2 and you are \add always \add*trying to deceive people. 
\q1
\v 20 You are always accusing members of your own family \add of doing wrong\add*, 
\q2 and slandering them. 
\q1
\v 21 You did \add all\add* those things, and I did not say anything to you, 
\q2 \add so\add* you thought that I was \add a sinner\add* just like you. 
\q1 But now I rebuke you and accuse you, right in front of you. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this, 
\q1 because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces, 
\q2 and there will be no one to rescue you. 
\q1
\v 23 The sacrifice that \add truly\add* honors me is to thank me \add for what I have done\add*; 
\q2 and I will save those who always do the things that I want them to.” 
\c 51  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time when the prophet Nathan rebuked David after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba 
\q1
\v 1 O God, be merciful to me, 
\q2 because you love me faithfully; 
\q2 because you are very merciful, 
\q2 erase \add the record of\add* the ways that I disobeyed you! 
\q1
\v 2 Make me pure from the wrong things that I have done; 
\q2 make me clean from \add the guilt of\add* my sin. 
\b
\q1
\v 3  \add I say that\add* because I know the ways that I have disobeyed you; 
\q2 I cannot forget them. 
\q1
\v 4 You, you only, are the one that I have \add really\add* sinned against, 
\q2 and you have seen the evil things that I have done. 
\q1 When you say that I am guilty, you are right/correct, 
\q2 and when you judge me, you justly say \add that I deserve to be punished\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 I have been a sinner since the day that I was born; 
\q2 \add truly\add*, I have been like that since my mother conceived me. 
\q1
\v 6 What you desire is that I desire what is true 
\q2 in order that you \add can\add* teach me how to act wisely. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Purify me from the guilt of my sins, and \add after that happens\add*, I will be clean \add in my inner being\add*; 
\q2 cleanse me, and \add then in my inner being\add* I will be ◄whiter than snow/very clean►. 
\q1
\v 8 Allow/Cause me to be joyful [DOU] again; 
\q2 you have ◄crushed my spirit/completely discouraged me► [MTY]; 
\q1 \add but now\add* let me rejoice \add again\add*. 
\q1
\v 9 Do not continue to look at the sins [IDM] that I have committed; 
\q2 erase the record of the evil things that I have done. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 O God, cause my inner being to be pure. 
\q2 Put new \add thoughts \add* within me and make me faithful again. 
\q1
\v 11 Do not send me away from you \add because of my sin\add*, 
\q2 and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. 
\q1
\v 12 Cause/Allow me to be happy again because of \add knowing\add* that you have freed me \add from the guilt of my sin\add*, 
\q2 and make me willing \add to obey you\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 If you do that, I will \add be able to\add* teach \add other\add* sinners what you want them to do, 
\q2 and they will repent and begin to obey you. 
\q1
\v 14 O God, you are the one who saves me; 
\q2 forgive me for being guilty of causing someone \add who was not my enemy\add* to die. 
\q2 \add When you do that\add*, I will sing joyfully about your being very good and righteous. 
\q1
\v 15 O Yahweh, help me to speak 
\q2 \add in order that\add* I may praise you. 
\q1
\v 16 You are not pleased \add only\add* with the sacrifices \add that people bring to you\add*. 
\q2 If that were \add enough to\add* please you, I would bring you sacrifices. 
\q1 You are not pleased with burnt offerings \add alone\add*. 
\q1
\v 17 The sacrifice that you \add really\add* want is for people to be truly humble and sorry \add for having sinned\add*; 
\q2 O God, you will not refuse that kind of sacrifice. 
\b
\q1
\v 18  \add O God\add*, be good to \add the people who live in\add* Jerusalem [MTY], 
\q2 \add and help them\add* to rebuild the city walls. 
\q1
\v 19 When that happens, \add they will bring you\add* the proper sacrifices, 
\q2 animals that they will completely burn, 
\q2 young bulls that they wiill burn on your altar, 
\q2 and you will be pleased. 
\c 52  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, when Doeg went to Saul and said, “David has gone to talk with Ahimelech, the Supreme Priest” 
\q1
\v 1 You people \add think that you\add* are strong 
\q2 and brag about the sins that you have committed, 
\q1 while you plan to harm godly people. 
\q1
\v 2 All during the day you plan to get rid of \add others\add*; 
\q1 what you say [MTY] \add injures others\add* like a sharp razor [SIM], 
\q2 and you are \add always\add* deceiving \add others\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 You like \add doing what is\add* evil more than you like doing what is good, 
\q2 and you like telling lies more than you like telling the truth. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 4 You who say things [MTY] to deceive people, 
\q2 you like to say ◄things that hurt people/cruel things►! 
\b
\q1
\v 5 But God will get rid of you forever; 
\q2 he will grab you and drag you from your home 
\q2 and take you away from this world where people are alive. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 6 When righteous \add people\add* see that, they will be awestruck, 
\q2 and they will laugh at \add what happened to\add* you, and say, 
\q1
\v 7 “Look \add what happened to\add* the man who would not ask God to protect him; 
\q2 he trusted that his great wealth \add would save him\add*; 
\q2 he trusted in the money that he got by wickedly taking it from others!” 
\b
\q1
\v 8 But I am \add secure/safe because I worship\add* in God's temple; 
\q2 I am like a \add strong\add* green olive tree. 
\q1 I trust in God, who faithfully loves us forever. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, I will always thank you for the things that you have done. 
\q2 As I stand before godly \add people\add*, I will proclaim that you are good (OR, the many good [MTY] \add things you have done for us\add*). 
\c 53  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using a tune called ❛Mahalath❜ 
\q1
\v 1  \add Only\add* foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!” 
\q1 People who say that are corrupt; they commit terrible sins; 
\q2 there is not one of them who does what is good/right. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 God looks down from heaven and sees humans; 
\q1 he looks to see if anyone is \add very\add* wise, 
\q2 with the result that he seeks \add to know\add* God. 
\q1
\v 3  \add But\add* they are all morally corrupt; 
\q2 no one does what is good/right. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Will all these evil people never learn \add what God will do to them\add*? 
\q1 They act violently toward Yahweh's people while eating the food that he provides, 
\q2 and they never pray to Yahweh. 
\q1
\v 5 But \add some day\add* those people will become terrified, 
\q2 like they have never been terrified before, 
\q1 because God will cause those who are separated from him to die, 
\q2 and he will \add disrespect them by\add* scattering their bones. 
\q1 They have rejected God, 
\q2 so he will cause them to be \add defeated and\add* completely disgraced. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 I wish/desire that someone from Jerusalem [MTY] would come and rescue the Israeli \add people\add*! 
\q2 God, when you bless your people again, 
\q1 \add all\add* the Israeli \add people, all the descendants of\add* Jacob, will rejoice.

\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; it was written when the people of Ziph went to Saul and told him that David was hiding in their area 
\q1
\v 1 God, by your power [MTY, DOU] save me \add from my enemies\add*, 
\q2 and show people that I have not done anything that is wrong! 
\q1
\v 2 God, listen to my prayer; 
\q2 listen to what I say to you, 
\q1
\v 3 because strangers are \add trying to\add* attack me; 
\q2 proud men are wanting to kill me; 
\q2 men who do not have any ◄respect for/interest in► you. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 4 But God is the one who helps me; 
\q2 Yahweh defends/protects me \add from my enemies\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 He will cause the evil things that they want to do to me to happen to them instead; 
\q2 because he faithfully \add does what he promises\add*, he will get rid of them. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh, I will gladly give an offering to you because I want to, 
\q2 and I will thank you [MTY], for you are good \add to me\add*; 
\q1
\v 7 you have rescued me from all my troubles, 
\q2 and I have seen that you have defeated my enemies. 
\c 55  
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments 
\q1
\v 1 God, listen to my prayer, 
\q2 and do not turn away from me while I am pleading with you. 
\q1
\v 2 Listen to me, and answer me, 
\q2 because I am overwhelmed by \add all\add* my troubles. 
\q1
\v 3 My enemies cause me to be terrified; 
\q2 wicked people oppress me. 
\q2 They cause me to have great troubles; 
\q2 they are angry with me, and they hate me. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 I am terrified, 
\q2 and I am very much afraid that I will die. 
\q1
\v 5 I am very fearful and I tremble/shake, 
\q2 and I am completely terrified. 
\q1
\v 6 I said, “I wish that I had wings like a dove! 
\q1 If I had wings, I would fly away and find a place to rest. 
\q1
\v 7 I would fly far away 
\q2 and live in the desert. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 8 I would quickly find a shelter from \add my enemies\add* 
\q2 \add who are like\add* [MET] a strong wind and rainstorm.” 
\b
\q1
\v 9 Lord, confuse my enemies, and cause their plans to fail, 
\q2 because I see them acting violently and causing strife in the city \add of Jerusalem\add*. 
\q1
\v 10 During \add each\add* day and night they march around on top of its walls, 
\q2 committing crimes and causing trouble. 
\q1
\v 11 They destroy \add things\add* everywhere. 
\q2 They oppress and defraud \add people\add* in the ◄marketplaces/public squares►. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 If it were an enemy who was making fun of me, 
\q2 I could endure it. 
\q1 If it were someone who hates me, who despises me, 
\q2 I could hide from him. 
\q1
\v 13 But it is someone who is just like me, my companion, 
\q2 someone who was my friend \add who is doing this to me\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 We previously had many good talks together; 
\q2 we walked around together in God's temple. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 I desire/hope that my enemies will die suddenly; 
\q2 while they are still young, cause them to go down to the place where the dead people are. 
\q2 They they think evil things. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 But I \add will\add* ask Yahweh, \add my\add* God, to help me, 
\q2 and he will save me. 
\q1
\v 17  \add Each\add* morning and \add each\add* noontime and \add each\add* evening I tell him what I am concerned about, and I moan, 
\q2 and he hears my voice. 
\q1
\v 18 I have \add very\add* many enemies, 
\q2 but he will rescue me and bring me back safely from the battles that I fight. 
\q1
\v 19 God is the one who has ruled everything forever, 
\q2 and he will listen to me. 
\q1 He will cause my enemies to be \add defeated and\add* disgraced, 
\q2 because they do not change their evil behavior 
\q2 and they do not reevere God. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 20 My companion, \add whom I mentioned previously\add*, betrayed his friends 
\q2 and broke the agreement that he made with them. 
\q1
\v 21 What he said was \add easy to listen to, like\add* butter \add is easy to swallow\add* [MET], 
\q2 but in his inner being he hated people; 
\q1 his words were \add soothing\add* like \add olive\add* oil, 
\q2 \add but they hurt people like\add* sharp swords do [MET]. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Put your troubles in Yahweh's hands, 
\q2 and he will take care of you; 
\q1 he will never allow righteous \add people\add* to experience disasters. 
\q1
\v 23 God, you will cause murderers [MTY] and liars to die before they have lived half as long as they expect to live; 
\q2 but \add as for me\add*, I will trust in you.

\q1
\v 1 God, be merciful to me because men have harassed me; 
\q2 all day my enemies pursue me. 
\q1
\v 2 My enemies harass me all day long;

\q1
\v 4 God, I praise/thank you because you do what you have promised; 
\q2 I trust in you, and then I am not afraid. 
\q2 Ordinary humans certainly cannot [RHQ] harm me! 
\b
\q1
\v 5 All day long my enemies claim that I said things that I did not say (OR, try to destroy what I am doing); 
\q2 they are always thinking of ways to harm me. 
\q1
\v 6 In order to cause trouble for me, they hide 
\q2 and watch everything that I do, 
\q2 waiting for \add an opportunity\add* to kill me [MTY]. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing; 
\q2 show that you are angry by defeating those people! 
\q1
\v 8 You have counted \add all\add* the times that I have been wandering alone/distressed; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* you have put \add all\add* my tears in a bottle

\q2 I know that will happen, because you are fighting for me. 
\q1
\v 10 I praise/thank you that you do what you have promised; 
\q2 Yahweh, I \add will always\add* praise you for that [DOU]. 
\q2
\v 11 I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid. 
\q2 I know that humans cannot really [RHQ] harm me! 
\b
\q1
\v 12 I will bring to you the offering that I promised; 
\q1 I will bring an offering to you to thank you, 
\q1
\v 13 because you have rescued me from being killed; 
\q2 you have kept me from stumbling. 
\q1 As a result, I will continue to live in your presence in the light that \add shines on those who are still\add* alive (OR, in the light that \add enables people to\add* live).

\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ❛Do not destroy❜ 
\q1
\v 1 When you mighty men speak, you never say what is right; 
\q2 you never decide things about people justly [RHQ]! 
\q1
\v 2 No, in your inner beings you think only about doing what is wrong, 
\q2 and you commit violent crimes in this land \add of Israel\add*.

\v 7 Cause them to disappear like water disappears \add in dry ground\add*!

\q1
\v 1  \add I prayed\add*, “God, you have rejected us \add Israelis\add*!

\q2 because \add it is as though\add* our country is ◄falling apart/being destroyed►.

\v 3 But righteous people should be joyful; 
\q2 they should rejoice when they are in God's presence; 
\q2 they should be happy, and be very joyful.

\v 5 God, who lives in his sacred temple, is \add like\add* [MET] a father to \add those who are\add* orphans,

\v 7 God, you led your people out \add of Egypt\add*, 
\q2 and then you marched with them through the desert.

\q1 the earth shook, 
\q2 and rain poured down from the sky. 
\q1
\v 9 You caused plenty of rain to fall \add on your land\add**, 
\q2 \add and so\add* you enabled good crops to grow again on the land that you gave \add to us Israelis\add*.

\v 10 Your people built homes there;

\q2 \add When our army brought back to their homes\add* the things that they captured,

\v 17  \add After we defeated all our enemies\add*,

\q1
\v 21 But God will smash the heads of his enemies, 
\q2 the skulls of those who continue to behave sinfully. 
\q1
\v 22 The Lord said, “I will bring back the \add corpses of those who were killed in\add* Bashan, 
\q1 and I will bring back those who sank deep in the ocean \add and drowned\add*. 
\q2
\v 23 I will do that in order that you may wash your feet in their blood, 
\q2 and your dogs can \add also\add* lap up some of your enemies' blood.” 
\b
\q1
\v 24 God, many people see you march triumphantly into your sacred temple, 
\q2 \add celebrating that you have defeated your enemies\add*. 
\q2 You \add march like\add* a king does, and a large crowd walks with you. 
\q1
\v 25 The singers are in front, and the people who play stringed instruments are at the rear, 
\q2 and young women who are beating their tambourines are between them. 
\q1
\v 26  \add They are all singing\add*, “You Israeli people, praise God when you gather together; 
\q2 praise Yahweh, all you who are descendants of Jacob!” 
\q1
\v 27 First come \add the people of the tribe of\add* Benjamin, the smallest \add tribe\add*, 
\q2 and following them come the leaders of \add the tribe of\add* Judah and their group, 
\q1 and following them come the leaders of \add the tribes of\add* Zebulun and Naphtali. 
\q1
\v 28 God, show people that you are very powerful; 
\q2 show people the power with which you have helped us previously. 
\q1
\v 29 Show that power from your temple in Jerusalem, 
\q2 where kings bring gifts to you. 
\q1
\v 30 Rebuke \add your enemies, such as those in Egypt who are like\add* wild hippopotamuses/animals that live in the reeds;

\q1 rebuke/trample them until they bow down and give you gifts of silver. 
\q2 Scatter the people who enjoy making wars. 
\q1
\v 31 Then people will bring gifts of bronze (OR, of cloth) to you from Egypt;

\v 13  \add So, God\add*, I think it is useless that I have [RHQ] always done what you want me to, 
\q2 and that I have not sinned. 
\q1
\v 14 All day long I have problems, 
\q2 and every morning you punish me. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 If I had said the things that the wicked people say, 
\q2 I would have been sinning against your people. 
\q1
\v 16 And when I tried to think about all this, 
\q2 it was very difficult for me \add to understand it\add*. 
\q1
\v 17 But when I went to your temple, \add you spoke to me\add*, 
\q2 and I understood what will happen to the wicked people \add after they die\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 18  \add Now I know that\add* you will surely put them in slippery places, 
\q2 and they will fall down and die. 
\q1
\v 19 They will be destroyed instantly; 
\q2 they will die in terrible ways. 
\q1
\v 20 They \add will disappear as quickly\add* as a dream disappears when a person awakes in the morning; 
\q2 Lord, when you arise, you will ◄cause them to disappear/forget all about them►. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 When I felt sad/bitter , 
\q1 and brokenhearted, 
\q1
\v 22 I was stupid and ignorant, 
\q2 and I behaved like an animal toward you. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 But I am always close to you, 
\q1 and you hold my hand. 
\q1
\v 24 You guide me by teaching me, 
\q2 and ◄at the end \add of my life\add*/when I die►, you will receive me and honor me. 
\q1
\v 25 You are in heaven and I belong to you [RHQ], 
\q1 and there is nothing on this earth that I desire more than that. 
\q1
\v 26 My body and my mind may become very weak, 
\q2 but God, you continue to enable me to be strong; 
\q2 I belong to you forever. 
\b
\q1
\v 27 Those who remain far from you will be destroyed; 
\q1 you will get rid of those who abandon you. 
\q1
\v 28 But \add as for\add* me, it is wonderful to be near to God 
\q2 and to be protected by Yahweh, 
\q2 and to proclaim to others all that he has done \add for me\add*.

\s1 A psalm written by Asaph 
\q1
\v 1 God, why have you abandoned/rejected us? 
\q2 Will you keep rejecting us forever [RHQ]? 
\q1 Why are you angry with us, 
\q2 since we are like sheep in your pasture \add and you are like our shepherd\add*? [MET, RHQ] 
\q1
\v 2 Do not forget your people whom you chose long ago, 
\q2 the people whom you freed \add from being slaves in Egypt\add* and caused to become your tribe. 
\q1 Do not forget Jerusalem, which was ◄your home/where you dwelt► \add on this earth\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 Walk along \add and see\add* where everything has been totally ruined; 
\q2 our enemies have destroyed everything in the sacred temple. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Your enemies shouted triumphantly in this sacred place; 
\q1 they erected their banners \add to show they had defeated us\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 They cut down all the \add engraved objects in the temple\add* like woodsmen cut down trees. 
\q1
\v 6 Then they smashed all the carved wood with their axes and hammers. 
\q1
\v 7  \add Then\add* they burned your temple to the ground; 
\q2 they caused that place where you were worshiped to be unfit for people to worship in. 
\q1
\v 8 They said to themselves, “We will destroy the Israelis completely,” 
\q2 and they \add also\add* burned down all the other places where we gathered to worship God. 
\q1
\v 9 All our sacred symbols (OR, miracles) are gone; 
\q2 there are no prophets now/anymore, 
\q2 and no one knows how long \add this situation will continue\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 God, how long will our enemies make fun of you [RHQ]? 
\q1 Will they insult you [MTY] forever [RHQ]? 
\q1
\v 11 Why do you refuse to help [MTY, RHQ] us? 
\q2 Why do you keep your hand inside your cloak \add instead of using it to destroy our enemies\add* [RHQ]? 
\b
\q1
\v 12 God, you have been our king \add all the time\add* since we came out of Egypt [HYP], 
\q1 and you have enabled us to defeat \add our enemies\add* in the land \add of Israel\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 By your power you caused the \add Red\add* Sea to divide; 
\q2 \add it was as though\add* you smashed the heads of the \add rulers of Egypt who were like\add* huge sea dragons [MET]. 
\q1
\v 14  \add It was as though\add* you crushed the head of the king of Egypt [MET] 
\q2 and gave his body to the animals in the desert to eat. 
\q1
\v 15 You caused springs and streams to flow, 
\q2 and you \add also\add* dried up rivers that had never dried up previously. 
\q1
\v 16 You created the days and the nights, 
\q2 and you put the sun and the moon in their places. 
\q1
\v 17 You determined where the oceans end and the land begins, 
\q2 and you created the summer/hot season and the winter/cold season. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh, do not forget that your enemies laugh at you, 
\q1 and that it is foolish people who despise you [MTY]. 
\q1
\v 19 Do not let your helpless people [MET] fall into the hands of their cruel enemies; 
\q1 do not forget your suffering/persecuted people. 
\q1
\v 20 Do not forget the agreement that you made with us; 
\q2 remember that there are violent people in every dark place on the earth. 
\q1
\v 21 Do not allow your oppressed people to be disgraced; 
\q2 help those poor and needy people in order that they will \add again\add* praise you [MTY]. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 God, arise and defend yourself \add by defending your people\add*! 
\q1 Do not forget that foolish people laugh at you ◄all day long/continually►! 
\q1
\v 23 Do not forget that your enemies shout angrily \add at you\add*; 
\q2 the uproar that they make \add while they oppose you\add* never stops.

\s1 A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ❛Do not destroy❜ 
\q1
\v 1 We give thanks to you; 
\q2 our God, we thank you. 
\q1 You are close to us, 
\q2 and we proclaim to others the wonderful things that you have done \add for us\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 2  \add You have said\add*, “I have appointed a time when I will judge people, 
\q2 and I will judge \add everyone\add* fairly. 
\q1
\v 3 When the earth shakes 
\q2 and all the creatures on the earth tremble, 
\q1 I am the one who will ◄keep its foundations steady/prevent it from being destroyed►. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 4 I say to people who ◄boast/talk proudly about themselves►, ‘Stop bragging!’ 
\q1 and I say to wicked people, ‘Do not proudly \add do things to\add* show how great you are [IDM]! 
\q1
\v 5 Do not be arrogant, 
\q2 and do not speak so boastfully!’” 
\b
\q1
\v 6 The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west, 
\q1 and he does not come from the desert. 
\q1
\v 7 God is the one who judges people; 
\q2 he says that some have sinned and must be punished, and that others have not done what is wrong. 
\q1
\v 8  \add It is as though\add* Yahweh holds a cup in his hand; 
\q2 it is filled with wine that \add has spices\add* mixed in it \add to cause those who drink it to become more drunk\add*; 
\q1 and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it; 
\q2 they will drink every drop of it, 
\q2 \add which means that he will give them all the punishment that they deserve\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 But \add as for me\add*, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob \add worshiped has done\add*; 
\q1 I will never quit singing to praise him. 
\q1
\v 10 He will destroy the power [IDM] of wicked people, 
\q1 but he will cause righteous people to become more powerful.. 
\c 76  
\s1 A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments 
\q1
\v 1 People in Judah know God; 
\q1 the Israeli people honor him [MTY]. 
\q1
\v 2 His home is in Jerusalem; 
\q2 he lives on Zion \add Hill\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 There he broke the flaming arrows \add that his enemies shot\add*, 
\q2 \add and he also broke\add* their shields and swords and other weapons that they used in battles. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 4 God, you are glorious! 
\q1 You are like a king \add as you return from\add* the mountains \add where you defeated your enemies\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 Their brave soldiers \add were killed, and then those who killed them\add* took away everything that those soldiers had. 
\q1 Those enemies died [EUP], 
\q2 \add so\add* they were unable to use their weapons \add anymore\add*! 
\q1
\v 6 When you, the God whom Jacob \add worshiped\add*, rebuked \add your enemies\add*, 
\q2 \add the result was that their\add* horses and their riders fell down dead. 
\q1
\v 7 But you cause everyone to be afraid. 
\q1 When you are angry \add and you punish people\add*, no one can [RHQ] endure it. 
\q1
\v 8 From heaven you proclaimed that you would judge people, 
\q2 \add and then everyone on\add* the earth was afraid and did not say \add anything more\add*, 
\q2
\v 9 when you arose to declare that you would punish \add wicked people\add* 
\q2 and rescue all those whom they had oppressed. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 10 When \add you punish those\add* with whom you are angry, your people will praise you, 
\q2 and \add your enemies\add* who ◄survive/are not killed► will worship you on your festival days. 
\b
\q1
\v 11  \add So\add* give to Yahweh the offerings that you promised to give to him; 
\q2 all the people of nearby people-groups should also bring gifts to him, the one who is awesome. 
\q1
\v 12 He humbles [IDM] princes, 
\q2 and \add even\add* causes \add great\add* kings to be terrified. 
\c 77  
\s1 A psalm written by Asaph for Jeduthun, the choir director 
\q1
\v 1 I cry out to God; 
\q1 I cry aloud to him, and he hears me. 
\q1
\v 2 Whenever have trouble, I pray to the Lord; 
\q2 all during the night I lift up my hands while I pray, 
\q2 \add but\add* nothing causes me to be comforted. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 When I think about God, I ◄despair/think that he will never help me►; 
\q1 when I meditate about him, I am discouraged. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 4  \add All during the night\add* he prevents me from sleeping; 
\q2 I am very worried, with the result that I do not know what to say. 
\q1
\v 5 I think about days that have passed; 
\q2 I remember \add what happened in\add* previous years. 
\q1
\v 6 I spend the whole night thinking \add about things\add*; 
\q2 I meditate, and this is what I ask myself: 
\q1
\v 7 “Will the Lord always reject us? 
\q2 Will he never again be pleased with us? 
\q1
\v 8 Has he stopped faithfully loving us? 
\q1 Will he not do for us what he promised to do? 
\q1
\v 9 God promised to be merciful to us; has he forgotten that? 
\q2 Because he is angry \add with us\add*, has he decided to not be kind to us?” 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q1
\v 10 Then I said, “What causes me to be \add very\add* sad is that 
\q1 \add it seems that\add* God, who is greater than any other god, is no longer powerful.” 
\b
\q1
\v 11  \add But then\add*, Yahweh, I recall/remember your great deeds; 
\q2 I remember the wonderful things that you did in the past. 
\q2
\v 12 I meditate on all that you have done, 
\q2 and I think about your mighty acts. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 God, everything that you do is holy; 
\q2 there is certainly no god [RHQ] who is great like you are! 
\q1
\v 14 You are God, the one who performs miracles; 
\q2 you showed to people of many people-groups that you are powerful. 
\q1
\v 15 By your power [MTY] you rescued your people \add from Egypt\add*; 
\q2 you saved those who were descendants of Jacob and \add his son\add* Joseph. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q1
\v 16  \add It was as though\add* the waters \add of the Red Sea\add* saw you and became very afraid, 
\q2 and even the deepest part of the water shook. 
\q1
\v 17 Rain poured down from the clouds [PRS]; 
\q2 it thundered \add very loudly\add* [PRS], 
\q2 and lightning flashed in all directions. 
\q1
\v 18 Thunder crashed in the whirlwind, 
\q2 and lightning ◄lit up/flashed across► the entire sky [HYP]; 
\q1 the earth shook violently [DOU]. 
\q1
\v 19  \add Then\add* you walked through the sea 
\q2 on a path that you made through the deep water, 
\q2 but your footprints could not be seen. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 You led your people like \add a shepherd leads his\add* flock \add of sheep\add*, 
\q2 while Moses and Aaron were the leaders \add of your people\add*. 
\c 78  
\s1 A psalm written by Asaph 
\q1
\v 1 My friends, listen to what I am going to teach you; 
\q2 pay careful attention [IDM] to what I say. 
\q1
\v 2 I am going to give you some sayings that wise people have said. 
\q2 They will be sayings about things that happened long ago, 
\q2 things that were difficult to understand [MET], 
\q1
\v 3 things that we have heard and known previously, 
\q2 things that our parents and grandparents told us. 
\q1
\v 4 We will tell these things to our children [LIT], 
\q1 and we will also tell to our grandchildren 
\q2 \add about\add* Yahweh's power and the glorious/great things that he has done. 
\q1
\v 5 He gave laws and commandments to the Israeli people, 
\q1 \add those who are the descendants of\add* Jacob [DOU], 
\q1 and he told our ancestors to teach them to their children 
\q1
\v 6 in order that their children would \add also\add* know them 
\q2 and then they would teach them to their children. 
\q1
\v 7 In that way, they also would trust in God, 
\q2 and not forget the things that he has done; 
\q1 instead, they would obey his commandments. 
\q1
\v 8 They would not be like their ancestors, 
\q2 who were very stubborn and kept rebelling \add against God\add*; 
\q1 they did not continue firmly trusting in God, 
\q2 and they did not worship only him. 
\b
\q1
\v 9  \add The soldiers of\add* the tribe of Ephraim had bows \add and arrows\add* 
\q1 but they ran away \add from their enemies\add* on the day that they fought a battle with their enemies. 
\q1
\v 10 They did not do what they had agreed with God that they would do; 
\q2 they refused to obey his laws. 
\q1
\v 11 They forgot what he had done; 
\q2 they forgot about the miracles that they had seen him perform. 
\q1
\v 12 While our ancestors were watching, 
\q1 God performed miracles in the area around Zoan \add city\add* in Egypt. 
\q1
\v 13  \add Then\add* he caused the \add Red\add* Sea to divide, 
\q2 causing the water \add on each side\add* to pile up like a wall, 
\q2 with the result that \add our ancestors\add* walked through it \add on dry ground\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 He led them by a \add bright\add* cloud during the day 
\q1 and by a fiery light during the night. 
\q1
\v 15 He split rocks open in the desert, 
\q1 giving to our ancestors plenty of water from deep inside the earth. 
\q1
\v 16 He caused a stream of water to flow from the rock; 
\q2 the water flowed like a river [DOU]. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 But \add our ancestors\add* continued to sin against God; 
\q1 in the desert they rebelled against the one who is greater than any other god. 
\q1
\v 18 By demanding that God give them the food that they desired, 
\q1 they tried to find out if he would always do what they requested him to do. 
\q1
\v 19 They insulted God by saying, “We don't think he can supply food for us \add here\add* in this desert! 
\q1
\v 20  \add It is true that\add* he struck the rock, 
\q2 with the result that water gushed/flowed out, 
\q1 \add but\add* ◄can he also provide bread and meat for \add us\add*, his people?/we doubt that he can also provide bread and meat for us, his people.►” [RHQ] 
\q1
\v 21 So, when Yahweh heard that, he became very angry, 
\q2 and he sent a fire to burn up \add some of\add* his Israeli \add people\add*. [MTY, DOU] 
\q2
\v 22  \add He did that\add* because they did not trust in him, 
\q2 and they did not believe that he would rescue them. 
\q1
\v 23 But God spoke to the sky above them; 
\q2 he commanded it to open \add like\add* a door, 
\q1
\v 24 and \add then food\add* fell down like rain, 
\q3 \add food which they named\add* ❛manna❜; 
\q2 God gave them grain from ◄heaven/the sky►. 
\q1
\v 25  \add So\add* the people ate the food that angels eat, 
\q2 \add and\add* God gave to them all the manna that they wanted. 
\q1
\v 26  \add Later\add*, he caused the wind to blow from the east, 
\q2 and by his power he also sent wind from the south, 
\q1
\v 27 and the wind brought birds 
\q2 which were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore. 
\q1
\v 28 God caused those birds to fall \add dead\add* in the middle of ◄their camp►/the area where the people had put up their tents. 
\q2 \add There were dead birds\add* all around their tents. 
\q1
\v 29  \add So\add* the people \add cooked the birds and\add* ate the meat and their stomachs were full, 
\q2 because God had given them what they wanted. 
\q1
\v 30 But before they had eaten all that they wanted, 
\q2 and while they were still eating it, 
\q1
\v 31 God was \add still\add* very angry with them, 
\q2 and he caused their strongest men to die; 
\q2 he got rid of \add many of\add* the finest \add young\add* Israeli men. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 In spite of all that, the people continued to sin; 
\q1 in spite of all the miracles that God had performed, 
\q2 they still did not trust that he \add would take care of them\add*. 
\q1
\v 33 So, he caused their lives to end as quickly as a puff of wind ends; 
\q2 they died when disasters suddenly struck them. 
\q1
\v 34 When God caused \add some of\add* them to die, 
\q1 \add the others\add* turned to God; 
\q1 they repented and earnestly asked God \add to save them\add*. 
\q1
\v 35 They remembered that God is \add like\add* a huge rock ledge \add under which they would be safe\add* [MET], 
\q1 and that he, who was greater than any other god, is the one who protected/rescued them. 
\q1
\v 36 But they \add tried to\add* deceive God by what they said [MTY]; 
\q2 their words [MTY] were \add all\add* lies. 
\q1
\v 37 They were not loyal to him; 
\q2 they disregarded/ignored the agreement that he had made with them. 
\q1
\v 38 But God was merciful to his people. 
\q1 He forgave them for having sinned 
\q2 and did not get rid of them. 
\q1 Many times he refrained from becoming angry \add with them\add* 
\q1 and restrained from furiously/severely \add punishing them\add* [MTY]. 
\q1
\v 39 He remembered/considered that they were only humans who die; 
\q2 they \add disappear quickly\add* [SIM], like a wind that blows by and then is gone. 
\b
\q1
\v 40 Many times our ancestors rebelled against God in the desert 
\q1 and caused him to become very sad. 
\q1
\v 41 Many times they did evil things, to find out \add if they could do those things without God punishing them\add*. 
\q2 They frequently caused the holy God of Israel to become disgusted/sad. 
\q1
\v 42 They forgot about his \add great\add* power, 
\q2 and they ◄forgot/did not think► about the time when he rescued them from their enemies. 
\q1
\v 43 They forgot about when he performed many miracles 
\q2 in the area near Zoan \add city\add* in Egypt. 
\q1
\v 44 He caused the \add Nile\add* River (OR, their sources of water) to become \add red like\add* blood, 
\q2 with the result that the people of Egypt had no water to drink. 
\q1
\v 45 He sent among the people of Egypt swarms of flies that bit them, 
\q1 and he sent frogs that ate up everything. 
\q1
\v 46 He sent locusts to eat their crops 
\q1 and the other things that grew in their fields. 
\q1
\v 47 He sent hail that destroyed the grapevines, 
\q1 and sent frost that ruined the figs. 
\q1
\v 48 He sent hail that killed their cattle 
\q1 and sent lightning that killed their sheep and cows. 
\q1
\v 49 Because God was fiercely angry with the people of Egypt, 
\q1 he caused them to be very distressed. 
\q2 The disasters that struck them were like a group of angels that destroyed \add everything\add*. 
\q1
\v 50 He did not lessen his being angry \add with them\add*, 
\q2 and he did not ◄spare their lives/prevent them from dying►; 
\q1 he sent a ◄plague/serious illness► that killed \add many of\add* them. 
\q1
\v 51 He also caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die. 
\q1
\v 52 Then he led his people out \add of Egypt\add* like \add a shepherd leads\add* his sheep [SIM], 
\q2 and he guided them \add while they walked\add* through the desert. 
\q1
\v 53 He led them safely, and they were not afraid, 
\q2 but their enemies were drowned in the sea. 
\q1
\v 54  \add Later\add* he brought them to \add Canaan\add*, his sacred land, 
\q2 to \add Zion\add* Hill (OR, the hilly area) 
\q2 and by his power [MTY] he enabled them to conquer \add the people who were living there\add*. 
\q1
\v 55 He expelled the people-groups while his people were advancing; 
\q2 he allotted part of the land for \add each tribe\add* to possess, 
\q2 and he gave to the Israeli people the houses of those people who had been expelled. 
\b
\q1
\v 56 However, the Israeli people rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god, 
\q2 and they did many evil things to see if they could do those things without God punishing them, 
\q2 and they did not obey his commandments. 
\q1
\v 57 Instead, like their ancestors did, they rebelled against God and ◄were not loyal to/did not faithfully \add obey\add*► him; 
\q2 they were as \add unreliable as\add* a crooked arrow \add that does not go straight\add* [SIM]. 
\q1
\v 58 Because they \add worshiped\add* carved images of their gods on the tops of hills, 
\q1 they caused God to become angry [DOU]. 
\q1
\v 59 He saw what they were doing and became very angry, 
\q2 so he rejected the Israeli people. 
\q1
\v 60 He no longer appeared to them at Shiloh 
\q2 in the tent where he had lived among them. 
\q1
\v 61 He allowed their enemies to capture \add the sacred chest\add*, 
\q2 \add which was the symbol of\add* his power and his glory. 
\q1
\v 62 Because he was angry with his people, 
\q2 he allowed them to be killed [MTY] \add by their enemies\add*. 
\q1
\v 63 Young men were killed in battles, 
\q2 with the result that the young women had no one to marry. 
\q1
\v 64  \add Many\add* priests were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords, 
\q2 and ◄the people did not allow the priests' widows/the priests' widows were not allowed► to mourn. 
\b
\q1
\v 65 Later, \add it was as though\add* the Lord awoke from sleeping; 
\q1 he was like a strong man who ◄became stimulated/felt that he was strong► by (OR, became sober after) \add drinking\add* a lot of wine [SIM]. 
\q1
\v 66 He pushed their enemies back 
\q2 and caused them to be \add very\add* ashamed for a long time [HYP] 
\q2 \add because they had been defeated\add*. 
\q1
\v 67  \add But\add* he did not set up his tent where \add the people of\add* the tribe of Ephraim lived; 
\q2 he did not choose their area \add to do that\add*. 
\q1
\v 68 Instead he chose \add the area where\add* the tribe of Judah \add lived\add*; 
\q2 he chose Zion Hill, which he loves. 
\q1
\v 69 He \add decided to have\add* his temple built \add there\add*, high up, like \add his home in\add* heaven; 
\q1 he caused it to be firm, 
\q2 \add and intended that\add* his temple would last forever, like the earth. 
\q1
\v 70 He chose David, who served him \add faithfully\add*,

\s1 A psalm written by Asaph 
\q1
\v 1 God, other people-groups have invaded your land.

\q1 and they have destroyed all the buildings in Jerusalem. 
\q1
\v 2  \add Instead of burying\add* the corpses of your people \add whom they killed\add*, 
\q2 they allowed vultures and wild anmals to eat the flesh of those corpses, 
\q1
\v 3 When they killed your people, 
\q1 your people's blood flowed like water through \add the streets of\add* Jerusalem, 
\q2 and there was \add almost\add* no one [HYP] left to bury their corpses. 
\q1
\v 4 The people-groups that live in countries that surround our land insult us; 
\q2 they laugh at us and deride/belittle us.

\q1
\v 5 Yahweh, how long \add will this continue\add*? 
\q2 Will you be angry with us forever? 
\q1 Will your being angry \add destroy us like\add* a burning fire \add destroys things\add*? 
\q1
\v 6  \add Instead of being angry with us\add*, 
\q2 be angry with the people-groups that do not know/worship you! 
\q1 Be angry with kingdoms whose people do not pray to you, 
\q2
\v 7 because they have killed Israeli people 
\q2 and they have ruined your country. 
\q1
\v 8 Do not punish us because of the sins that our ancestors committed! 
\q1 Be merciful to us now/quickly, 
\q2 because we are very discouraged. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, you have saved/rescued \add us many times\add*, 
\q2 \add so\add* help us \add now\add*;

\q2 “If their God \add is very powerful\add*, ◄surely he should help them/why does he not \add help them\add*►?” 
\q1 Allow us to see you punishing the people of other nations in return for their shedding our blood; 
\q1 they have killed many of us, your people. 
\q1
\v 11 Listen to your people groaning while they are in prison, 
\q2 and by your great power free those whom our enemies say that they will certainly execute. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 In return for their having \add often\add* insulted you,

\q1
\v 12 So why have you abandoned us

\v 4  \add Do that\add* because that is a law for \add us\add* Israeli \add people\add*; 
\q2 God commanded it for us descendants of Jacob. 
\q2
\v 5 He commanded us Israeli \add people to obey it\add* when he punished \add the people of\add* Egypt. 
\b
\q1 I heard someone [MTY] whose voice I did not recognize, saying,

\v 6 “ \add After the rulers of Egypt forced you Israelis to work as slaves\add*, 
\q1 I took those \add heavy\add* burdens off your backs,

\q1
\v 11 But my people would not listen to me [SYN];

\s1 A psalm written by Asaph 
\q1
\v 1 God gathers all the \add rulers and judges who think they are\add* gods for a meeting in heaven;

\q1
\v 5 They have agreed on \add what they want to do to destroy Israel\add*,

\v 1 Yahweh, I will sing forever about the ways you faithfully love me;

\q1
\v 2 I will tell people that you will faithfully love us forever,

\v 6 There is no one [RHQ] in heaven who can be compared with you, Yahweh. 
\q2 There are no angels [RHQ] in heaven who are equal to you.

\v 7 When your holy angels gather together,

\q1
\v 8 O Yahweh, God Almighty, there is no one [RHQ] who is powerful like you are;

\q1
\v 19 Long ago you spoke in a vision to one of your servants/prophets, saying,

\v 20 That man is David, the one who will serve me \add faithfully\add*,

\q1
\v 23 I will crush his enemies in front of him 
\q2 and get rid of those who hate him. 
\q1
\v 24 I will always be loyal to him and faithfully love him

\v 35 Once I made a solemn promise to David, and that will never change,

\v 38 But \add Yahweh\add*, now you have rejected [DOU] David! 
\q2 You are very angry with the king whom you appointed. 
\q1
\v 39  \add It seems that\add* you have broken the agreement that you made with your servant, \add David\add*; 
\q2 it seems as though you \add have signaled hat he is no longer the king by \add* throwing his crown into the dust/dirt.

\v 40 You have torn down the walls \add that protect\add* his \add city\add*,

\v 41 All those who pass by plunder/steal his possessions;

\v 42 You have enabled his enemies to defeat him;

\q1
\v 43 You have caused his sword to become useless,

\q1
\v 44 You have caused his splendor to end (OR, You have taken away his power

\v 45 You have caused him to look old when he is still young

\q1
\v 47 Do not forget that life is very short;

\q1
\v 2 Before you created the mountains,

\q1 you were eternally God, 
\q2 and you will be God forever.

\q1
\v 3  \add When people die\add*, you cause their corpses to become soil again;

\q1
\v 4 When you ◄consider/think about► time, 
\q2 a thousand years are \add as short as\add* [SIM] one day which passes;

\q1
\v 5 You cause people suddenly to die [MET];

\q2 They are like grass/weeds [SIM] that grow up.

\v 6 In the morning [DOU] the grass sprouts and grows well,

\q1
\v 7  \add Similarly\add*, \add because of the sins that we have committed\add*, you become angry with us;

\q1
\v 8  \add It is as though\add* you place our sins in front of you, 
\q2 you spread out even our secret sins where you can see them. 
\q1
\v 9 Because you are angry with us, you cause our lives to end; 
\q2 the years that we live pass as quickly as a sigh does. 
\q1
\v 10 People live for only 70 years; 
\q2 but if they are strong, some of them live for 80 years.

\q1
\v 4 Ask Yahweh to help you and give you his strength, 
\q2 and continue to ask him! 
\b
\q1
\v 5-6 You people who are descendants of God's servant Abraham, 
\q2 you descendants of Jacob, the man God chose, 
\q2 think about \add all\add* the wonderful things that he has done: 
\q2 He performed miracles, and he punished \add all our enemies\add*. 
\q1
\v 7 He is Yahweh, our God. 
\q1 He rules and judges \add people\add* throughout the earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 He never forgets the agreement that he made; 
\q2 he made a promise that will last for a thousand generations; 
\q1
\v 9 that is the agreement that he made with Abraham, 
\q2 and he repeated that agreement with Isaac. 
\q1
\v 10  \add Later\add* he confirmed it \add again\add* to Jacob 
\q2 as an agreement for the Israeli \add people\add* that would last forever. 
\q1
\v 11 What he said was, “I will give you the Canaan region; 
\q2 it will belong to you \add and your descendants forever\add*.” 
\b
\q1
\v 12  \add He said that to them\add* when there were only a few of them, 
\q2 a tiny group of people who were living in that land like strangers. 
\q1
\v 13 They continued to wander from one place to another, 
\q2 from one kingdom to another. 
\q1
\v 14 But he did not allow others to oppress them. 
\q2 He warned those kings by saying to them, 
\q1
\v 15 “Do not do harm the \add people\add* whom I have chosen! 
\q2 Do not harm my prophets!” 
\b
\q1
\v 16 He sent a famine to Canaan, and \add as a result all the people\add* had no food to eat. 
\q1
\v 17 So his people went to Egypt, but first he sent someone there. 
\q2 He sent Joseph, who had been sold to be a slave. 
\q1
\v 18  \add Later, while Joseph was in prison in Egypt\add*, 
\q2 they put his legs in shackles that bruised his feet, 
\q1 and they put an iron collar around his neck. 
\q1
\v 19 There, Yahweh ◄refined Joseph's character/tested Joseph to see if Joseph would continue to trust him►, 
\q2 until what Joseph predicted would happen ◄came true/happened►. 
\q1
\v 20 The king \add of Egypt\add* summoned him, and he set Joseph free; 
\q2 this ruler of many people-groups released Joseph \add from prison\add*. 
\q1
\v 21  \add Then\add* he appointed him to take care of everything in the king's household, 
\q2 to take care of everything that the king possessed. 
\q1
\v 22 ◄Joseph was permitted/He permitted Joseph► to command the king's servants 
\q2 to do anything that Joseph wanted them to do, 
\q2 and \add even\add* to tell the king's advisors the things that they should do \add for the people of Egypt\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Later, \add Joseph's father\add* Jacob arrived in Egypt. 
\q2 He lived like a foreigner in the land that belonged to the descendants of Ham. 
\q1
\v 24 And \add years later\add* Yahweh caused the descendants of Jacob to become very numerous. 
\q2 \add As a result\add*, their enemies, \add the Egyptians\add*, considered that the Israelis were too strong. 
\q1
\v 25  \add So\add* Yahweh caused the rulers of Egypt to ◄turn against/hate► the Israeli people, 
\q2 and they planned ways to get rid of his people. 
\q1
\v 26  \add But then\add* Yahweh sent his servant Moses 
\q2 along with \add Moses' older brother\add* Aaron, whom Yahweh had \add also\add* chosen \add to be his servant\add*. 
\q1
\v 27 Those two performed amazing miracles among the people of Egypt, 
\q2 in that land where the descendants of Ham lived. 
\q1
\v 28 Yahweh sent darkness, so that the people of Egypt could not see anything [DOU], 
\q2 but the rulers of Egypt refused [RHQ] to obey when \add Moses and Aaron\add* commanded \add them to let the Israeli people leave Egypt\add*. 
\q1
\v 29 Yahweh caused \add all\add* the water in Egypt to become ◄blood/ \add red like\add* blood►, 
\q2 and \add his doing that\add* caused all the fish to die. 
\q1
\v 30  \add Then he caused\add* the land to become full of frogs; 
\q2 the king and his officials even had frogs in their bedrooms. 
\q1
\v 31  \add Then\add* Yahweh commanded that flies come, and swarms of them descended \add on the people of Egypt\add*, 
\q2 and gnats \add also\add* swarmed across the whole country. 
\q1
\v 32 Instead of sending rain, Yahweh sent \add terrible\add* hail, 
\q2 and lightning flashed throughout the land. 
\q1
\v 33 The hail ruined their grapevines and fig trees 
\q2 and shattered all the \add other\add* trees. 
\q1
\v 34 He commanded locusts to come, and swarms of them came; 
\q2 \add so many that\add* they could not be counted. 
\q1
\v 35 The locusts ate every green plant in the land, 
\q2 ruining all the crops. 
\q1
\v 36  \add Then\add* Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house \add of the people of Egypt\add* [DOU]. 
\b
\q1
\v 37 Then he brought the Israeli \add people\add* out \add from Egypt\add*; 
\q2 they were carrying loads of \add jewelry made of\add* silver and gold \add that the women of Egypt had given to them\add*. 
\q1 No one was left behind because of being sick. 
\q1
\v 38  \add The people of\add* Egypt were glad when the Israeli people left, 
\q2 because they had become very afraid of the Israelis. 
\q1
\v 39  \add Then\add* Yahweh spread a cloud to cover the Israelis; 
\q2 and \add at night it became\add* a big fire \add in the sky\add* to give them light. 
\q1
\v 40  \add Later\add* the Israelis asked for \add meat to eat\add*, 
\q2 and Yahweh sent \add flocks of\add* quail to them, 
\q1 and he gave them plenty of manna \add food\add* from the sky \add each morning\add*. 
\q1
\v 41  \add One day\add* he caused a rock to open up and water poured out \add for them to drink\add*; 
\q2 it was like a river flowing in that desert. 
\b
\q1
\v 42  \add He did that\add* because he kept thinking about the sacred promise \add that he had given\add* to his servant, Abraham. 
\q1
\v 43 So his people were joyful as he brought them out from Egypt; 
\q2 those people whom he had chosen were shouting joyfully as they went. 
\q1
\v 44 He gave to them the land that belonged to the people-groups \add that lived there in Canaan\add*, 
\q2 and the Israelis harvested crops that \add other\add* people had planted. 
\q1
\v 45  \add Yahweh did all these things\add* 
\q2 in order that his people would do all the things that he had commanded them to do [DOU]. 
\b
\q1 Praise Yahweh! 
\c 106  
\q1
\v 1 Praise Yahweh! 
\q1 Praise Yahweh, because he does good things \add for us\add*; 
\q2 he faithfully loves \add us\add* forever/continually! 
\q1
\v 2  \add Because Yahweh has done many great things\add*, 
\q2 no one can [RHQ] tell all the great things that Yahweh has done, 
\q2 and no one can praise him enough/sufficiently. 
\q1
\v 3 ◄Happy are/He is pleased with► those who act fairly/justly, 
\q2 with those who always do what is right. 
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh, be kind to me when you help your people; 
\q2 help me when you rescue/save them. 
\q1
\v 5 Allow me to see it when your people become prosperous again 
\q2 and when \add all the people of\add* your nation, \add Israel\add*, are happy; 
\q2 allow me to be happy with them! 
\q2 I want to praise you along with \add all\add* those \add others\add* who belong to you. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 We and our ancestors have sinned; 
\q2 we have done things that were very wicked [DOU]. 
\q1
\v 7 When our ancestors were in Egypt, 
\q2 they did not pay attention to the wonderful things that Yahweh did; 
\q2 they forgot about the many times that he showed that he faithfully loved them. 
\q1 Instead, when they were at the Red Sea, 
\q2 they rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god. 
\q1
\v 8 But he rescued them for the sake of his own \add reputation\add* 
\q2 in order that he could show that he is very powerful. 
\q1
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea and it became dry, 
\q2 and \add then\add* while he led our ancestors across it, 
\q2 they walked through it as though it were as dry as a desert [SIM]. 
\q1
\v 10 In that way he rescued them from the power [MTY] of their enemies who hated them [DOU]. 
\q1
\v 11  \add Then\add* their enemies were drowned in the water \add of the Red Sea\add*; 
\q2 not one of them was left. 
\q1
\v 12 When that happened, our ancestors believed \add that Yahweh had truly done for them\add* what he had promised to do, 
\q2 and they sang to praise him. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 But they soon forgot what he had done for them; 
\q2 they \add did things\add* without waiting to find out what Yahweh wanted them to do. 
\q1
\v 14 They intensely wanted \add food like they formerly ate in Egypt\add*. 
\q2 They \add did evil things to\add* find out \add if they could do those things without God punishing them\add*. 
\q1
\v 15  \add So\add* he gave them what they requested, 
\q2 but he \add also\add* caused a terrible disease to afflict them. 
\b
\q1
\v 16  \add Later\add* when \add some of\add* the men became jealous of Moses 
\q1 and \add his older brother\add* Aaron, who was dedicated \add to serve Yahweh by being a priest\add*, 
\q1
\v 17 the ground opened up and swallowed Dathan 
\q2 and \add also\add* buried Abiram and his family. 
\q1
\v 18 And \add God sent\add* a fire down \add from heaven\add* 
\q2 which burned up \add all\add* the wicked \add people who ◄supported them/agreed with► them\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 Then the \add Israeli leaders\add* made a gold statue at Sinai \add Mountain\add* 
\q2 and worshiped it. 
\q1
\v 20 Instead of worshiping \add our\add* glorious God, 
\q2 they \add started to\add* worship a statue of a bull that eats grass! 
\q1
\v 21 They forgot about God, who had rescued them by the great miracles that he performed in Egypt. 
\q1
\v 22 They forgot about the wonderful things that he did for them in Egypt 
\q2 and the amazing/awesome things that he did for them at the Red Sea. 
\q1
\v 23 Because of that, God said that he would get rid of the Israelis, 
\q2 but Moses, whom God had chosen \add to serve him\add*, pleadeed with God \add not to get rid of them\add*. 
\q2 And as a result God did not destroy them. 
\b
\q1
\v 24  \add Later\add*, our ancestors ◄refused/were afraid► to enter beautiful \add Canaan\add* land 
\q2 because they did not believe \add that God would enable them to take the land from the people who were living there, as\add* he had promised. 
\q1
\v 25 They stayed in their tents and grumbled 
\q2 and would not pay attention to what Yahweh said that they should do. 
\q1
\v 26 So he solemnly [MTY] told them 
\q2 that he would cause them to die \add there\add* in the desert, 
\q2
\v 27 and that he would scatter their descendants among the \add people of other\add* nations/people-groups \add who did not believe in him\add*, 
\q2 and that he would allow them to die in those lands. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 Later the Israeli people \add started to\add* worship \add the idol of\add* Baal \add who they thought lived\add* at Peor \add Mountain\add*, 
\q1 and they ate \add meat that had been\add* sacrificed to \add Baal and those other\add* lifeless gods. 
\q1
\v 29 Yahweh became \add very\add* angry because of what they had done, 
\q2 \add so again\add* he sent a terrible disease to attack/strike them. 
\q1
\v 30 But Phinehas stood up and punished/killed \add the ones who had sinned greatly\add*, 
\q2 and as a result the ◄plague/serious disease► ended. 
\q1
\v 31 People have remembered that righteous thing that Phinehas did, 
\q2 and in future years people will remember it. 
\b
\q1
\v 32  \add Then\add* at Meribah Springs our ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry, 
\q2 and as a result Moses had trouble. 
\q1
\v 33 They caused Moses to become very angry [IDM], 
\q2 and he said things that were foolish. 
\b
\q1
\v 34 Our ancestors did not destroy the people \add who did not believe in Yahweh\add* 
\q2 like he told them to do. 
\q1
\v 35 Instead, they mingled with people from those people-groups, 
\q2 and they started to do the evil things that those people did. 
\q1
\v 36 Our ancestors worshiped the idols of those people, 
\q2 which resulted in their being destroyed/exiled/taken to another country [MET]. 
\q1
\v 37  \add Some of\add* the Israelis sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons \add that those idols represented\add*. 
\q1
\v 38 They killed [MTY] their own children, who ◄were innocent/had not done things that were wrong►, 
\q1 and offered them as sacrifices to the idols in Canaan. 
\q2 \add As a result\add*, Canaan land was polluted by those murders [MTY]. 
\q1
\v 39 So by their deeds they caused themselves to become unacceptable to God; 
\q2 \add because they did not faithfully worship only God\add*, 
\q2 \add they became like\add* women who sleep with other men \add instead of sleeping only with their husbands\add* [MET]. 
\b
\q1
\v 40 So Yahweh became very angry with his people; 
\q2 he was completely disgusted with them. 
\q1
\v 41  \add As a result\add* he allowed people-groups \add who did not believe in him\add* to conquer them, 
\q2 so those who hated our ancestors started to rule over them. 
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies ◄oppressed them/treated them cruelly► 
\q2 and completely controlled them [MET]. 
\q1
\v 43 Many times Yahweh rescued them, 
\q2 but they continued to rebel against him, 
\q2 and they were finally destroyed because of the sins that they committed. 
\b
\q1
\v 44 However, Yahweh \add always\add* heard them when they cried out to him; 
\q2 he listened to them when they were distressed. 
\q1
\v 45 For their sake, he thought about the agreement/promise that he had made \add to bless\add* them, 
\q2 and because he never stopped loving them very much, 
\q2 he changed his mind \add about punishing them more\add*. 
\q1
\v 46 He caused all those who had taken the Israelis \add to Babylonia\add* to ◄feel sorry for/pity► them. 
\b
\q1
\v 47 Yahweh our God, rescue/save us 
\q1 and bring us back \add to Israel\add* from among those people-groups 
\q2 in order that we may thank you [MTY] 
\q2 and joyfully praise you. 
\b
\q1
\v 48 Praise Yahweh, the God whom \add we\add* Israelis \add worship\add*, 
\q1 praise him now and forever! 
\b
\q1 And I want everyone to say, “Amen/May it be so!” 
\q2 Praise Yahweh! 
\c 107  
\ms1 Book Five 
\q1
\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, because he always does good \add things for us\add* 
\q2 His faithful love \add for us\add* lasts forever! 
\q1
\v 2 Those whom Yahweh has saved should tell others 
\q2 that he has rescued them from their enemies. 
\q1
\v 3 He has gathered \add those of you\add* who were \add ◄exiled/taken forcefully►\add* to many lands; 
\q2 \add he has gathered you together from\add* the east and the west, 
\q2 from the north and from the south. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Some of those \add who returned from those countries\add* wandered in the desert; 
\q2 they were lost and had no homes to live in. 
\q1
\v 5 They were hungry and thirsty, 
\q2 and they were very discouraged. 
\q1
\v 6 When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh, 
\q2 and he rescued them from ◄being distressed/their difficulties►. 
\q1
\v 7 He led them along a straight road \add where they walked safely\add* 
\q2 to cities \add in Canaan\add* where they could live. 
\q1
\v 8 They should praise/thank Yahweh for loving them faithfully 
\q2 and for the wonderful things that he does for people. 
\q1
\v 9 He gives thirsty people plenty \add of water\add* to drink, 
\q2 and he gives hungry people plenty of good things \add to eat\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Some of them were in very dark [HEN] ◄places \add in Babylonia/other countries\add*►; 
\q2 they were prisoners, suffering because of chains \add fastened to their hands and feet\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 They were in prison because they had ◄rebelled against/not obeyed► the message of God; 
\q1 they were there because they had despised the advice given by God, 
\q2 who is greater than all other gods. 
\q1
\v 12  \add That is why\add* their bodies were worn out from hard labor; 
\q2 when they fell down, there was no one who would help them. 
\q1
\v 13 In their troubles, they called out to Yahweh, 
\q2 and he rescued them from their being distressed. 
\q1
\v 14 He broke the chains that were on their hands and feet; 
\q2 and brought them out of those very dark \add prisons\add*. 
\q1
\v 15-16 He broke down the \add prison\add* gates that were made of bronze, 
\q2 and cut through the \add prison\add* bars that were made of iron. 
\q1 \add So they also\add* should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving \add them\add*, 
\q2 and for \add all\add* the wonderful things that he does for people. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Some of them foolishly rebelled \add against God\add*, 
\q2 so they suffered for their sins. 
\q1
\v 18 They did not want to eat any food, 
\q2 and they almost died. 
\q1
\v 19 In their troubles, they \add also\add* called out to Yahweh, 
\q2 and he rescued them from their being distressed. 
\q1
\v 20 When he commanded that they be healed, they were healed; 
\q2 he saved them from dying. 
\q1
\v 21 They \add also\add* should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them, 
\q2 and for \add all\add* the wonderful things that he does for people. 
\q1
\v 22 They should give offerings to him to show that they are thankful, 
\q2 and they should sing joyfully about the miracles that he has performed. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Some of them sailed in ships; 
\q2 they were selling things \add in ports\add* throughout the world. 
\q1
\v 24  \add As they were sailing\add*, they also saw the miracles that Yahweh performed, 
\q2 the wonderful things that he did \add when they were\add* on very deep seas. 
\q1
\v 25 He commanded the winds, and they became strong 
\q2 and ◄stirred up high waves/caused waves to rise high►. 
\q1
\v 26 The ships \add in which they were sailing\add* were tossed high in the air, 
\q2 and \add then\add* they sank into the ◄troughs/low places► \add between the high waves\add*; 
\q1 then the sailors were terrified. 
\q1
\v 27 They stumbled about and staggered like drunken men, 
\q2 and they did not know what to do. 
\q1
\v 28 In their troubles, they \add also\add* called out to Yahweh, 
\q2 and he rescued them from their distresses. 
\q1
\v 29 He ◄calmed the storm/caused the wind to stop blowing►, 
\q2 and he caused the waves to completely subside. 
\q1
\v 30 They were \add very\add* glad when it became calm; 
\q2 and Yahweh brought them safely into a harbor. 
\q1
\v 31 They \add also\add* should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving \add them\add*, 
\q2 and for \add all\add* the wonderful things that he does for people. 
\q1
\v 32 They should praise him among the \add Israeli\add* people when they have gathered together, 
\q2 and they should praise him in front of the leaders \add of the country\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 33  \add Sometimes\add* Yahweh causes rivers \add to become dry\add*, 
\q2 \add with the result that the land\add* becomes a desert, 
\q2 and springs of water become dry land. 
\q1
\v 34  \add Sometimes\add* he causes land that has produced lots of crops to become salty wastelands, 
\q2 \add with the result that they do not produce crops\add*. 
\q2 He does that because the people who live there are \add very\add* wicked. 
\q1
\v 35  \add But sometimes\add* he causes pools of water to appear in deserts, 
\q2 and he causes springs to flow in very dry ground. 
\q1
\v 36 He brings hungry \add people\add* into that land, to live there and build cities \add there\add*. 
\q1
\v 37 They plant seeds in their fields, 
\q2 and they plant grapevines that produce big crops \add of grapes\add*. 
\q1
\v 38 He blesses the people, and the women give birth to many children, 
\q2 and they have large herds of cattle. 
\b
\q1
\v 39 When the number of people becomes smaller and they have been humiliated \add by their enemies\add* 
\q2 by being oppressed and caused to suffer [DOU], 
\q1
\v 40 Yahweh shows contempt for the leaders who oppress them, 
\q2 and causes them to wander in deserts where there are no roads. 
\q1
\v 41 But he rescues poor \add people\add* from ◄being in misery/suffering►, 
\q2 and causes their families \add to increase in number \add* like flocks of sheep. 
\q1
\v 42 Godly/Righteous \add people will ◄see/hear about►\add* these things, and they will rejoice, 
\q2 and wicked people \add will hear about these things, too\add*, 
\q2 \add but\add* they will have nothing to say in reply. 
\b
\q1
\v 43 Those who are wise should think carefully about those things;

\v 4 I show them that I want to be their friends 
\q1 and I pray for them, 
\q2 but \add instead of being kind to me\add*, they say that I have done evil things. 
\q1
\v 5 In return for my doing good things for them and loving them, 
\q2 they do evil things to me and hate me. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 They said, “Appoint a wicked \add judge\add* who will judge him, 
\q1 and bring in one of his enemies who will stand up and accuse him. 
\q1
\v 7 And cause that when the trial \add ends\add*, 
\q2 \add the judge will\add* declare that he is guilty, 
\q2 and that \add even\add* his prayer will be considered to be a sin. 
\q1
\v 8  \add Then\add*, cause that he will soon die 
\q2 and that someone else will have his job/work (OR, possessions). 
\q1
\v 9 Cause that his children will not have a father anymore 
\q2 and that his wife will become a widow. 
\q1
\v 10 Cause that his children will be forced to leave the ruined homes that they have been living in 
\q2 and wander around begging for food. 
\q1
\v 11 Cause that all the people to whom he owed money will seize all his property; 
\q2 Cause that strangers will take away everything that he worked to acquire. 
\q1
\v 12 Cause that \add while he is still living\add* no one will be kind to him, 
\q2 and \add after he dies\add*, cause that no one will pity his children. 
\q1
\v 13 Cause that all his descendants will die 
\q2 and that his grandchildren will not remember who he [MTY] was. 
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh, remember \add and do not forgive\add* his ancestors for the evil things that they did, 
\q2 and do not \add even\add* forgive the sins that his mother committed; 
\q1
\v 15 think about his sins continually, 
\q2 and cause that his name will be completely forgotten. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 He never was kind to anyone; 
\q2 he ◄persecuted/cause problems for► poor and needy \add people\add* 
\q2 and even killed helpless \add people\add*. 
\q1
\v 17 He liked to curse \add people\add*. 
\q2 \add So\add* cause those terrible things that he requested to happen to others to happen to him! 
\q1 He did not want to bless \add others\add*, 
\q2 \add so\add* cause that no one will bless him! 
\q1
\v 18 He cursed other people \add as often/easily\add* as he put on his clothes [SIM]; 
\q2 cause that the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others will \add happen to him and\add* enter his body like water \add that he drinks\add* [SIM], 
\q2 like \add olive\add* oil soaks into a person's bones \add when it is rubbed on his skin\add* [SIM]. 
\q1
\v 19 Cause that those terrible things will cling to him like his clothes 
\q1 and be around him like the belt that he wears every day.” 
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh, I want you to punish all my enemies that way, 
\q2 those who say evil things about me. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 But Yahweh, my God, do good things for me 
\q2 in order that I may honor you; 
\q1 rescue me \add from my enemies\add* 
\q2 because your faithfully loving me is good. 
\q1
\v 22  \add I ask you to do this\add* because I am poor and needy 
\q2 and my inner being is ◄full of pain/very troubled/discouraged►. 
\q1
\v 23  \add I think that\add* my time \add to remain alive\add* is short, 
\q2 like an evening shadow \add that will soon disappear\add* [SIM]. 
\q2 I will be blown away like a locust/grasshopper is blown \add by the wind\add*. 
\q1
\v 24 My knees are weak because I have ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► very often, 
\q2 and my body has become very thin. 
\q1
\v 25 The people who accuse me make fun of me;

\v 26 Yahweh, my God, help me! 
\q1 Because you faithfully love \add me\add*, rescue me! 
\q1
\v 27  \add When you save me\add*, 
\q2 cause my enemies to know that you are the one who has done it! 
\q1
\v 28 They may curse me, but I ask that you bless me. 
\q2 Cause those who ◄persecute/cause problems for► me \add to be defeated and as a result\add* to be disgraced/ashamed, 
\q1 and cause me to be glad/happy! 
\q1
\v 29 Cause those who accuse me to be completely disgraced; 
\q2 cause \add other people to see\add* that they are disgraced, as \add easily as they see\add* the clothes that they wear [SIM]! 
\b
\q1
\v 30 But I will thank Yahweh very greatly;

\c 110  
\s1 A psalm written by David 
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh said to my lord \add the king\add*, 
\q1 “Sit \add here\add*, close to me, in the place of highest honor [MTY] 
\q2 until I \add completely defeat\add* your enemies [MET] 
\q2 \add and\add* make \add them like\add* a stool for your feet!”

\v 3 On the day that you lead your armies into battle,

\q1
\v 4 Yahweh has made a solemn promise,

\q2 \add serving Yahweh \add* like Melchizedek did.” 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh stands \add in the place of highest honor \add*at your right side;

\q1
\v 6 He will judge and punish the people of \add many\add* nations; 
\q2 he will fill the land with their corpses. 
\q1 He will crush the heads of other kings all over the earth. 
\q1
\v 7 But my lord the king will drink from streams near the road; 
\q2 he will be refreshed after defeating his enemies. 
\c 111  
\q1
\v 1 Praise Yahweh!

\q1
\v 5 He provides food for those who revere him; 
\q2 he never forgets the agreement that he made \add with our ancestors\add*. 
\q1
\v 6 By enabling his people to capture the lands that belonged to other people-groups, 
\q1 he has shown to \add us\add*, his people, that he is very powerful. 
\q1
\v 7 He [MTY] faithfully \add does what he has promised\add* and always does what is just/fair, 
\q2 and we can depend on him \add to help us\add* when he commands us to do things.

\q1
\v 6 Righteous people will not be overwhelmed/worried/distressed \add because of their troubles\add*,

\v 8 They are confident and not afraid,

\v 2 Yahweh should be praised now and forever! 
\q1
\v 3 People who live in the east and people who live in the west, 
\q2 everyone, should praise Yahweh [MTY]! 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh rules [MTY] over all the nations, 
\q1 and high in the heavens he shows that his glory is very great. 
\q1
\v 5 There is no one [RHQ] who is like Yahweh, our God, 
\q2 who lives/sits/rules in the highest heaven, 
\q2
\v 6 and looks far down through the heavens and sees the \add people on\add* the earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 7  \add Sometimes\add* he lifts poor people up \add so that they no longer sit in\add* the dirt;

\q1
\v 8 and causes them to \add be honored\add* by sitting next to princes, 
\q2 the sons of the kings \add who rule\add* their people. 
\q1
\v 9 He also enables women who have no children to have a family; 
\q2 he causes them to be happy mothers. 
\b
\q1 Praise Yahweh! 
\c 114  
\q1
\v 1 When the Israeli \add people\add* left Egypt, 
\q1 when they who were descendants of Jacob left people who spoke a foreign/different language, 
\q2
\v 2  \add the land of\add* Judah became the place where people worshiped God; 
\q2 and Israel became the land (OR, the \add Israeli people\add* became the people) that he ruled over. 
\b
\q1
\v 3  \add When they came to the Red Sea\add*, 
\q1 \add it was as though\add* the water saw them and ran away! 
\q1 When they came to the Jordan \add River\add*, 
\q2 that \add water in the\add* river stopped flowing \add so that the Israelis could cross it\add*. 
\q1
\v 4  \add When they came to Sinai Mountain and there was a big earthquake\add*, 
\q2 \add it was as though\add* the mountains skipped/jumped like goats do 
\q2 and the hills jumped around like lambs do. 
\b
\q1
\v 5  \add If someone asks\add*, “What happened at the \add Red\add* Sea that caused the water to run away? 
\q1 What happened that caused \add the water in\add* the Jordan \add River\add* to stop flowing? 
\q1
\v 6 What happened that caused the mountains to skip like goats 
\q2 and caused the hills to jump around like lambs?” 
\b
\q1
\v 7  \add I would reply that\add* it was the presence of the Lord that caused those things to happen! 
\q1 \add Everyone/Everything on\add* the earth should tremble in the presence of God, whom ◄Jacob \add worshiped\add*/the Israeli people \add worship\add*►! 
\q1
\v 8 He is the one who caused pools of water \add for the Israeli people to drink to flow\add* from a rock; 
\q2 he caused a spring \add to flow\add* from a solid rock cliff! 
\c 115  
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, people should praise \add only\add* you [MTY]; 
\q2 they must praise you, not us, 
\q2 because you faithfully love us and always do what you have promised to do. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 It is not right that [RHQ] \add other\add* people-groups should say about us, 
\q1 “ \add They claim that\add* their God \add is very powerful\add*, 
\q2 but \add if that is true\add*, why does he not \add help them\add*?” 
\q1
\v 3 Our God is in heaven, 
\q2 and he does whatever he wants to! 
\q1
\v 4  \add But\add* their idols are only \add statues made of\add* silver and gold, 
\q2 things that humans have made. 
\q1
\v 5 Their idols have mouths, but they cannot say \add anything\add*; 
\q2 they have eyes, but they cannot see \add anything\add*.

\q1
\v 8 The people who make those idols are \add as powerless\add* as those idols,

\q1
\v 9 You, \add my fellow\add* Israeli people, trust in Yahweh!

\q1
\v 14 I desire that Yahweh will give many children

\v 17 Dead \add people\add* are not \add able to\add* praise Yahweh;

\q1 Praise Yahweh! 
\c 116  
\q1
\v 1 I love Yahweh,

\q1
\v 2 He listens to me, 
\q2 so I will call out to him all during my life. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 Everything around me [MET] caused me to think that I would die; 
\q2 I was very afraid that I would \add die and go to\add* the place where dead people are. 
\q1 I was very distressed/worried and afraid. 
\q1
\v 4  \add But\add* then I called out to Yahweh, saying, 
\q2 “Yahweh, I plead with you to save/rescue me!” 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh is kind and does what is right; 
\q2 he is our God, and he acts mercifully \add to us\add*. 
\q1
\v 6 He protects those who ◄are helpless/cannot defend themselves►; 
\q2 and when I thought that I would die, he saved me. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 I must encourage/tell myself to ◄have inner peace/not worry anymore►,

\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh has saved me [SYN] from dying, 
\q2 and has kept/protected me from \add troubles that would cause me to\add* cry. 
\q1 He has kept/protected me from stumbling. 
\q1
\v 9  \add So here\add* on the earth, where people are still alive, 
\q2 I live knowing that Yahweh is \add directing\add* me. 
\q1
\v 10 I continued to believe/trust \add in Yahweh\add*, 
\q2 even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted/troubled.” 
\q1
\v 11  \add Even\add* when I was distressed/worried and said, “I cannot trust anyone,” 
\q2 \add I continued to trust in Yahweh\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 So now \add I will tell you\add* [RHQ] what I will offer to Yahweh, 
\q2 because of all the good things that he has done for me. 
\q1
\v 13 I will offer to him a cup \add of wine\add*

\q1
\v 14 When I am together with many [HYP] people who belong to Yahweh,

\b
\q1
\v 15 Yahweh is very grieved/sad when one of his people dies. 
\q1
\v 16 I am one of those who serve Yahweh; 
\q2 I serve him like my mother did. 
\q2 He has freed/saved me from dying (OR, from being fastened by chains). 
\b
\q1
\v 17  \add So\add* I will offer to him a sacrifice to thank him, 
\q1 and I will pray to him. 
\q1
\v 18-19 When I am together with many of [HYP] the people who belong to Yahweh, 
\q2 \add in the courtyard\add* outside his temple in Jerusalem,

\q1
\v 1 Tell Yahweh that you thank him very much for the good \add things that he has done for you\add* 
\q2 He faithfully loves \add us, his people\add*, forever.

\v 6 Yahweh is ◄on my side/helping me►,

\b
\q1
\v 8 It is better to trust in Yahweh

\q1
\v 9 It is better to trust Yahweh to protect \add us\add*

\b
\q1
\v 10 Armies of [MTY] many nations surrounded me,

\q1
\v 11 They completely surrounded me, 
\q2 \add but\add* I defeated them all by the power of Yahweh.
