    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2KI 1:12" />But Elijah replied, “I am a prophet; <char style="add">to prove that</char>, I command that fire come down from the sky and kill you and your soldiers!” Then a fire from God came down from the sky and killed the officer and his soldiers.<verse eid="2KI 1:12" /></para>
