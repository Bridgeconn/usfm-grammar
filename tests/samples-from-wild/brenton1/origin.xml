    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="RUT 1:1" />And it came to pass when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land: and a man went from Bethleem Juda to sojourn in the land of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. <verse eid="RUT 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="RUT 1:2" />And the man's name <char style="add">was</char> Elimelech, and his wife's name Noemin, and the names of his two sons Maalon and Chelaion, Ephrathites of Bethleem of Juda: and they came to the land of Moab, and remained there. <verse eid="RUT 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="RUT 1:3" />And Elimelech the husband of Noemin died; and she was left, and her two sons. <verse eid="RUT 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="RUT 1:4" />And they took to themselves wives, women of Moab; the name of the one <char style="add">was</char> Orpha, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years. <verse eid="RUT 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="RUT 1:5" />And both Maalon and Chelaion died also; and the woman was left of her husband and her two sons. <verse eid="RUT 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="RUT 1:6" />And she rose up and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned out of the country of Moab, for she heard in the country of Moab that the Lord <char style="add">had</char> visited his people to give them bread. <verse eid="RUT 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="RUT 1:7" />And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her: and they went by the way to return to the land of Juda. <verse eid="RUT 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="RUT 1:8" />And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Go now, return each to the house of her mother: the Lord deal mercifully with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. <verse eid="RUT 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="RUT 1:9" />The Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband: and she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. <verse eid="RUT 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="RUT 1:10" />And they said to her, We will return with thee to thy people. <verse eid="RUT 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="RUT 1:11" />And Noemin said, Return now, my daughters; and why do ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb to be your husbands? <verse eid="RUT 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="RUT 1:12" />Turn now, my daughters, for I am too old to be married: for I said, Suppose I were married, and should bear sons; <verse eid="RUT 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="RUT 1:13" />would ye wait for them till they should be grown? or would ye refrain from being married for their sakes? Not so, my daughters; for I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me. <verse eid="RUT 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="RUT 1:14" />And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her. <verse eid="RUT 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="RUT 1:15" />And Noemin said to Ruth, Behold, thy sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; turn now thou also after thy sister-in-law. <verse eid="RUT 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="RUT 1:16" />And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee; for whithersoever thou goest, I will go, and wheresoever thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people <char style="add">shall be</char> my people, and thy God my God. <verse eid="RUT 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="RUT 1:17" />And wherever thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, <char style="add">if I leave thee</char>, for death <char style="add">only</char> shall divide between me and thee. <verse eid="RUT 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="RUT 1:18" />And Noemin seeing that she was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her any more. <verse eid="RUT 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="RUT 1:19" />And they went both of them until they came to Bethleem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethleem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Noemin? <verse eid="RUT 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="RUT 1:20" />And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Noemin; call me 'Bitter,' for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me. <verse eid="RUT 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="RUT 1:21" />I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call ye me Noemin, whereas the Lord has humbled me and the Mighty One has afflicted me? <verse eid="RUT 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="RUT 1:22" />So Noemin and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethleem in the beginning of barley harvest.<verse eid="RUT 1:22" /></para>
