        <description>Do Publishing Verses \vp ...\vp* need to be closed? The current documentation displays: Syntax \vp text...\vp* However  Paratext creates and PTX Print typesets Publishing Verses without an explicit closer should this behavior be allowed? Can a publishing verse say anything about a regular verse \v that it is supposed to replace, like a publishing chapter does? 

        USFM is "\vp 21\wj" and Paratext considers \vp implicility closed, USFM 3.1 requires ending markers for character spans
