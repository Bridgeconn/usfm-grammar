\ms Dates in B.C. and A.D.
\p The initials \sc b.c.\sc* have traditionally been an abbreviation for “Before Christ.”
If \bk Luke\bk*'s dating is correct, then Jesus was born at least four years before the
years known as \sc a.d.\sc* began. (\sc a.d.\sc* stands for the Latin phrase “in the year
of our Lord”). Christian dating was actually not introduced until \sc a.d.\sc* 526 by a
monk named Dionysius Exiguus. He was given the job of creating a calendar for the feasts
of the church. He fixed the birth of Jesus in the Roman year 754, which was selected as
the first year of the Christian era beginning on January 1. Dionysius apparently
misjudged Herod's reign by about five years.
\p The initials \sc b.c.\sc*e. (Before the Common Era) and c.e. (in the Common Era) are
sometimes used for the traditional \sc b.c.\sc* and \sc a.d.\sc*
