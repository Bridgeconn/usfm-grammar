  <para style="ip">The opening words of <char style="bk">The Gospel according to Mark</char> tell its readers that the subject of this book is the Good News about Jesus Christ. With the coming of Jesus Christ, it announces, the time set by God to bring salvation to humankind has arrived (1.15). Though the book concentrates on his deeds and words, it is not a biography of Jesus of Nazareth. Only one year, or a little more, of Jesus' life appears to be recorded (chapters 1--10), and over one-third of the book (chapters 11--16) is taken up with the last week of Jesus in and near <char style="w">Jerusalem</char>. Nothing is said about his birth, childhood, home, or parents. When he first appears, unknown and unannounced, Jesus is a full-grown adult who comes to John the Baptist to be <char style="w">baptized</char> by him.</para>
