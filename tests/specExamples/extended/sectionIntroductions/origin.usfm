\v 12 At once the Spirit made him go into the desert, \v 13 where he stayed 40 days, being

\ms Jesus' Public Ministry in Galilee
\mr 1.14--9.50
\ip Jesus returns to Galilee and does not go back to Judea until the close of his public
ministry. There is no indication of how long his Galilean ministry lasted: only when he is
back in Judea is a \w festival \w* (\w passover\w* ) mentioned (14.1). He spends much of his
time in Capernaum (1.21; 2.1; 3.1, 20; 9.33) and other places around Lake Galilee (1.9; 2.13;
3.7; 4.1). Twice Jesus ventures out of Galilee: into the region of the Ten Towns (5.1-20) and
Phoenicia (7.24-31). His actions and teachings soon arouse opposition from the religious
leaders (2.6-7, 24; 3.6, 22; 7.1-13; 8.11-12), and before long he predicts his coming arrest,
condemnation, and crucifixion (8.31; 9.30-31).
\s1 Jesus Calls Four Fishermen
\r (Mt 4.12-22; Lk 4.14-15; 5.1-11)
\ip Jesus' message is about the arrival of the \w kingdom of god\w*, which will happen soon.
To prepare for it, the people need to repent (1.15). He immediately summons two pairs of
fishermen brothers to be his followers and helpers.

\v 14 After John had been put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News
