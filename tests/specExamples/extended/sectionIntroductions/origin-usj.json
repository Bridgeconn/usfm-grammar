Twice Jesus ventures out of Galilee: into the region of the Ten Towns (5.1-20) and\nPhoenicia (7.24-31). His actions and teachings soon arouse opposition from the religious\nleaders (2.6-7, 24; 3.6, 22; 7.1-13; 8.11-12), and before long he predicts his coming arrest,\ncondemnation, and crucifixion (8.31; 9.30-31)."
